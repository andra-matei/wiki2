'''International Business Machines Corporation''' (commonly referred to as '''IBM''') is a [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] [[technology]] company headquartered in [[Armonk, New York]], [[United States]], with operations in over 170 countries. The company originated in 1911 as the [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company]] (CTR) and was renamed &quot;International Business Machines&quot; in 1924. 

IBM manufactures and markets computer [[Computer hardware|hardware]], [[middleware]] and [[computer software|software]], and offers [[Internet hosting service|hosting]] and [[consultant|consulting services]] in areas ranging from [[mainframe computer]]s to [[nanotechnology]]. IBM is also a major research organization, holding the record for most [[patents]] generated by a business (as of 2016) for 23 consecutive years.&lt;ref name=&quot;patents&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2016/01/13/ibm-tops-us-patent-list-again/ |title=IBM Tops US Patent List, Again|date=2016-01-13 | work=Bloomberg|first=Alex|last=Barinka}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inventions by IBM include the &lt;!-- ALPHABETICAL ORDER, ONLY MOST NOTABLE HERE, OTHERS IN BODY OF ARTICLE--&gt;[[Automated teller machine|automated teller machine (ATM)]], the [[floppy disk]], the [[hard disk drive]], the [[magnetic stripe card]], the [[relational model|relational database]], the [[SQL|SQL programming language]], the [[Universal Product Code|UPC barcode]], the [[swap (finance)|financial swap]], and [[dynamic random-access memory]] (DRAM).&lt;!-- ALPHABETICAL ORDER, ONLY MOST NOTABLE HERE, OTHERS IN BODY OF ARTICLE--&gt;

IBM has continually shifted its business mix by exiting [[Commoditization|commoditizing]] markets and focusing on higher-value, more profitable markets. This includes [[Spin out|spinning off]] printer manufacturer [[Lexmark]] in 1991 and selling off its [[personal computer]] ([[ThinkPad]]) and [[x86]]-based [[IBM System x|server]] businesses to [[Lenovo]] (2005 and 2014, respectively), and acquiring companies such as [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|PwC Consulting]] (2002), [[SPSS]] (2009), and  [[The Weather Company]] (2016). Also in 2014, IBM announced that it would go &quot;[[Fabless manufacturing|fabless]]&quot;, continuing to design [[semiconductors]] but offloading manufacturing to [[GlobalFoundries]].

Nicknamed '''Big Blue''', IBM is one of 30 companies included in the [[Dow Jones Industrial Average]] and one of the world's largest employers, with (as of 2016) nearly 380,000 employees. Known as &quot;IBMers&quot;, IBM employees have been awarded five [[Nobel Prize]]s, six [[Turing Award]]s, ten [[National Medal of Technology|National Medals of Technology]] and five [[National Medal of Science|National Medals of Science]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of IBM}}
In the 1880s, technologies emerged that would ultimately form the core of what would become International Business Machines (IBM). Julius E. Pitrat patented the computing scale in 1885;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Images of America: IBM in Endicott |last1=Aswad  |first1=Ed |last2=Meredith |first2=Suzanne |year=2005 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |location= |isbn=0-7385-3700-4 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=YzlDdhWK3IsC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=julius+e.+pitrap+computing+scale#v=onepage&amp;q=julius%20e.%20pitrap%20computing%20scale&amp;f=false |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Dey invented the dial recorder (1888);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10204421 |title=Dey dial recorder, early 20th century |author= |work= |publisher=UK Science Museum |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Herman Hollerith]] patented the [[Electric Tabulating Machine]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/census-tabulator.html |title=Hollerith 1890 Census Tabulator |author= |work= |publisher=[[Columbia University]] |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Willard Bundy]] invented a time clock to record a worker's arrival and departure time on a paper tape in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.floridatimeclock.com/employee-punch-clocks.htm |title=Employee Punch Clocks |author= |work= |publisher=Florida Time Clock |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 16, 1911, their four companies were [[holding company|consolidated]] in New York State by [[Charles Ranlett Flint]] to form the [[Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company]] (CTR) based in [[Endicott, New York]].&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F00F15FD355A17738DDDA90994DE405B818DF1D3 NY Times June 10, 1911 ''Tabulating Concerns Unite: Flint &amp; Co.

They manufactured machinery for sale and lease, ranging from commercial scales and industrial time recorders, meat and cheese slicers, to tabulators and punched cards. [[Thomas J. Watson, Sr.]], fired from the [[National Cash Register Company]] by [[John Henry Patterson (NCR owner)|John Henry Patterson]], called on Flint and, in 1914, was offered CTR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Belden, Thomas Graham |author2= Belden, Marva Robins |year= 1962 |title= The Lengthening Shadow: The Life of Thomas J.

In 1937, IBM's tabulating equipment enabled organizations to process unprecedented amounts of data, its clients including the [[U.S. Government]], during its first effort to maintain the employment records for 26 million people pursuant to the [[Social Security Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/ibm.html | title=Early Automation Challenges for SSA | first=Larry | last=DeWitt |date = April 2000| accessdate=2 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Hitler's [[Third Reich]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/1388.wss|date=February 14, 2001|title=IBM Statement on Nazi-era Book and Lawsuit|publisher=IBM Press room}}&lt;/ref&gt; largely through the German subsidiary [[Dehomag]]. During the [[Second World War]] the company produced small arms for the American war effort ([[M1 Carbine]], and [[Browning Automatic Rifle]]).

In 1949, Thomas Watson, Sr., created IBM World Trade Corporation, a subsidiary of IBM focused on foreign operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;WTC1949&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-03.ibm.com/ibm/history/ibm100/us/en/icons/ibmworldtrade/ |title=The Creation of the World Trade Corporation |author= |work= |publisher=IBM Corp. |website= ibm.com|accessdate=8 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, he stepped down after almost 40 years at the company helm, and his son [[Thomas Watson, Jr.]] was named president. In 1956, the company demonstrated the first practical example of  [[artificial intelligence]] when Arthur L. Samuel of IBM's Poughkeepsie, New York, laboratory programmed an [[IBM 704]] not merely to play checkers but &quot;learn&quot; from its own experience.  In 1957, the [[FORTRAN]] scientific programming language was developed. In 1961, IBM developed the [[Sabre (computer system)|SABRE reservation system]] for [[American Airlines]] and introduced the highly successful [[IBM Selectric typewriter|Selectric]] typewriter. In 1963, IBM employees and computers helped NASA track the orbital flight of the Mercury astronauts. A year later it moved its corporate headquarters from New York City to [[Armonk, New York]]. The latter half of the 1960s saw IBM continue its support of space exploration, participating in the 1965 Gemini flights, 1966 Saturn flights and 1969 lunar mission. 
[[File:IBMinventions.png|thumb|IBM inventions: (clockwise from top-left) the [[hard-disk drive]], [[DRAM]], the [[UPC bar code]], and the [[magnetic stripe card]]]]
On April 7, 1964, IBM announced the first computer system family, the [[IBM System/360]]. Sold between 1964 and 1978, it spanned the complete range of commercial and scientific applications from large to small, allowing companies for the first time to upgrade to models with greater computing capability without having to rewrite their application. In 1974, IBM engineer [[George J. Laurer]] developed the [[Universal Product Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cummingsdesign.com/bar_code_history.htm |title=The history of the UPC bar code and how the bar code symbol and system became a world standard. |author= |work= |publisher=Cummingsdesign |accessdate=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM and the [[World Bank]] first introduced [[Swap (finance)|financial swaps]] to the public in 1981 when they entered into a swap agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Fundamentals of Corporate Finance |edition=9th, alternate |last1=Ross |last2 =Westerfield|last3= Jordan|year= 2010 |publisher=[[McGraw Hill]] |location= |isbn= |page=746 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[IBM PC]], originally designated IBM 5150, was introduced in 1981, and it soon became an industry standard. In 1991, IBM sold printer manufacturer [[Lexmark]]. 

In 1993, IBM posted a US$8 billion loss - at the time the biggest in American corporate history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.dhe.ibm.com/common/ssi/ecm/en/gbe03420usen/GBE03420USEN.PDF |format=PDF|title= Life science: Fade or flourish ?|first1= Guy|last1= Lefever|first2= Michele|last2= Pesanello|first3= Heather|last3= Fraser|first4=Lee|last4= Taurman|year=2011|publisher= IBM Institute for Business Value|accessdate=6 July 2013|location=p. 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lou Gerstner]] was hired as CEO from [[American Express]] to turn the company around. In 2002, IBM acquired [[PwC]] consulting, and in 2003 it initiated a project to redefine company values, hosting a three-day online discussion of key [[business]] issues with 50,000 employees. The result was three values: &quot;Dedication to every client's success&quot;, &quot;Innovation that mattersâ€”for our company and for the world&quot;, and &quot;Trust and personal responsibility in all relationships&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/sjp/04-27-2004.html%7ctitle=Speeches%7cpublisher=IBM%7cdate=2004-04-27|title=IBM About IBM - United States|publisher=|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Leading Change When Business Is Good: The HBR Interview--Samuel J.

In 2005, the company sold its personal computer business to Chinese technology company [[Lenovo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/19066.wss|title= IBM to Acquire Micromuse Inc.|publisher= IBM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 2009, it acquired software company [[SPSS Inc.]] Later in 2009, IBM's [[Blue Gene]] supercomputing program was awarded the [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation]] by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]. In 2011, IBM gained worldwide attention for its [[artificial intelligence]] program [[Watson (artificial intelligence software)|Watson]], which was exhibited on ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' where it won against game-show champions [[Ken Jennings]] and [[Brad Rutter]]. In 2012, IBM announced it has agreed to buy [[Kenexa]], and a year later it also acquired [[SoftLayer Technologies]], a [[web hosting service]], in a deal worth around $2 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/05/us-softlayer-ibm-idUSBRE9530NT20130605| title=IBM to buy website hosting service SoftLayer| author=Jennifer Saba | publisher=Reuters | date= 5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM has a valuable brand as a result of over 100 years of operations and marketing campaigns. Since 1996, IBM has been the exclusive technology partner for the [[Masters Tournament]], one of the four [[Men's major golf championships|major championships]] in [[Professional golf tours|professional golf]], with IBM creating the first Masters.org (1996), the first course cam (1998), the first iPhone app with live streaming (2009), and first-ever live 4K Ultra High Definition feed in the United States for a major sporting event (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clayton|first1=Ward|title=IBM and Masters Celebrate 20 Years|url=http://www.masters.com/en_US/news/articles/2016-04-02/ibm_and_masterscom_celebrate_20_years.html|publisher=Masters|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, IBM CEO [[Ginni Rometty]] became the third female member of the Master's governing body, the [[Augusta National Golf Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Weinman|first1=Sam|title=IBM CEO Ginni Rometty is Augusta National's third female member|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/story/ibm-ceo-ginni-rometty-is-augus|publisher=Golf Digest|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM is also a major sponsor in professional [[tennis]], with engagements at the [[US Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]], [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]], the [[Australian Open]], and the [[French Open]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Snyder|first1=Benjamin|title=Why IBM dominates the U.S. Open|url=http://fortune.com/2015/09/01/ibm-us-open-tennis-tech/|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company also sponsored the [[Olympic Games]] from 1960-2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiCarlo|first1=Lisa|title=IBM, Olympics Part Ways After 40 Years|url=http://www.forbes.com/2000/08/23/feat.html|publisher=Forbes|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Football League]] from 2003-2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jinks|first1=Beth|title=IBM Ends Its NFL Sponsorship Over Difference in Views|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-06-05/ibm-ends-its-nfl-sponsorship-over-difference-in-views|publisher=Bloomberg|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM has one of the largest workforces in the world, and employees at Big Blue are referred to as &quot;IBMers&quot;. The company was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935), training for females (1935), paid vacations (1937), and training for disabled people (1942). IBM hired its first black salesperson in 1946, and in 1952, CEO [[Thomas J. Watson, Jr.]] published the company's first written equal opportunity policy letter, one year before the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [[Brown vs. Board of Education]] and 11 years before the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The [[Human Rights Campaign]] has rated IBM 100% on its index of gay-friendliness every year since 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Search_the_Database&amp;Template=/CustomSource/WorkNet/srch_dtl.cfm&amp;srchtype=QS&amp;searchid=34&amp;orgid=1238|title=International Business Machines Corp. (IBM) profile|publisher=HRC Corporate Equality Index Score}}&lt;/ref&gt; with IBM providing same-sex partners of its employees with [[Health insurance|health benefits]] and an anti-discrimination clause. Additionally, in 2005, IBM became the first major company in the world to commit formally to not use [[genetic testing|genetic information]] in employment decisions; and in 2015, IBM was named to ''[[Working Mother|Working Mother's]]'' 100 Best Companies List for the 30th consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IBM Named To Working Mother's 100 Best Companies List For 30th Consecutive Year|url=https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47704.wss|publisher=IBM Newsroom|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IBM has several leadership development and recognition programs to recognize employee potential and achievements. For early-career high potential employees, IBM sponsors leadership development programs by discipline (e.g., [[management|general management]] (GMLDP), [[human resources management|human resources]] (HRLDP), [[finance]] (FLDP)). Each year, the company also selects 500 IBMers for the IBM Corporate Service Corps (CSC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The IBM Corporate Service Corps|url=http://www.ibm.com/ibm/responsibility/corporateservicecorps/|publisher=IBM CSC|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been described as the corporate equivalent of the [[Peace Corps]] and gives top employees a month to do [[humanitarian aid|humanitarian work]] abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why IBM Gives Top Employees a Month to Do Service Abroad|url=https://hbr.org/2014/11/why-ibm-gives-top-employees-a-month-to-do-service-abroad|publisher=Harvard Business Review|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For certain [[interns]], IBM also has a program called [[Extreme Blue]] that partners top business and technical students to develop high-value technology and compete to present their business case to the company's CEO at internship's end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-01.ibm.com/employment/us/extremeblue/ |title=Extreme Blue web page |publisher=01.ibm.com |date=2007-09-07 |accessdate=2010-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company also has various designations for exceptional individual contributors such as Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM), Research Staff Member (RSM), Distinguished Engineer (DE), and Distinguished Designer (DD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taft|first1=Derryl|title=IBM Launches Distinguished Designer Program|url=http://www.eweek.com/developer/ibm-launches-distinguished-designer-program.html|publisher=eWeek|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolific inventors can also achieve patent plateaus and earn the designation of [[IBM Master Inventor|Master Inventor]]. The company's most prestigious designation is that of [[IBM Fellow]]. Since 1963, the company names a handful of Fellows each year based on technical achievement. Other programs recognize years of service such as the Quarter Century Club established in 1924, and sellers are eligible to join the Hundred Percent Club, composed of IBM salesmen who meet their quotas, convened in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Each year, the company also selects 1,000 IBMers annually to award the Best of IBM Award, which includes an all-expenses paid trip to the awards ceremony in an exotic location.

IBM's culture has evolved significantly over its century of operations. In its early days, a dark (or gray) suit, white shirt, and a &quot;sincere&quot; tie constituted the public uniform for IBM employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strategic Marketing&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=Paul Russell |title=Strategic Marketing Communications: New Ways to Build and Integrate Communications |publisher=Kogan Page |year=1999 |page=24 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HYvbeQLf_gEC&amp;pg=PA24&amp;lpg=PA24&amp;dq=%22sincere+tie%22+ibm |isbn=0-7494-2918-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s, CEO [[Louis V.

In 2015, IBM started giving employees the option of choosing either a [[personal computer|PC]] or a [[Mac]] as their primary work device, resulting in IBM becoming the world's largest Mac shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Switch to Macs from PCs reportedly saves IBM $270 per user|url=http://www.cio.com/article/3001871/macbook/switch-to-macs-from-pcs-reportedly-saves-ibm-270-per-user.html|publisher=CIO|accessdate=12 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, IBM eliminated forced rankings and changed its annual performance review system to focus more on frequent feedback, coaching, and skills development.&lt;ref&gt;Shana Lebowitz, Business Insider. â€œ[http://www.businessinsider.com/ibm-now-uses-the-ace-app-to-give-and-receive-real-time-feedback-2016-5 After overhauling its performance review system, IBM now uses an app to give and receive real-time feedback].â€?
