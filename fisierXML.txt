See [[List of countries and outlying territories by area]] for more information.}} China's landscape is vast and diverse, ranging from [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland|forest steppes]] and the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] deserts in the arid north to [[subtropical]] forests in the wetter south. The [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]], [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges separate China from [[South Asia|south]] and [[Central Asia|central]] Asia. The [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River|Yellow]] rivers, the third and sixth longest in the world, respectively, run from the [[Tibetan Plateau]] to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is {{convert|14500|km|mi|sp=us}} long, and is bounded by the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], [[East China Sea|East China]], and [[South China Sea|South China]] seas.

China is a [[cradle of civilization]], with its known history beginning with an ancient civilization â€“ one of the world's earliest â€“ that flourished in the fertile basin of the [[Yellow River]] in the [[North China Plain]]. For millennia, China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies known as [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]]. Since 221&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}, when the [[Qin Dynasty]] first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the state has expanded, fractured and reformed numerous times. The [[Republic of China (1912â€“1949)|Republic of China]] (ROC) replaced the [[Qing Dynasty|last dynasty]] in 1912, and ruled the [[mainland China|Chinese mainland]] until 1949, when it was defeated by the Communist Party of China in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. The Communist Party established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949, while the ROC government relocated to Taiwan with its present capital in [[Taipei]]. Both the ROC and PRC continue to claim to be the legitimate government of all China.

China had the largest economy in the world for most of the past two thousand years, during which it has seen cycles of [[prosperity]] and decline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED460052&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED460052|last=Dahlman|first= Carl J|last2= Aubert|first2=Jean-Eric |title=China and the Knowledge Economy: Seizing the 21st Century.

The territory of China lies between [[latitude]]s [[18th parallel north|18Â°]] and [[54th parallel north|54Â° N]], and [[longitude]]s [[73rd meridian east|73Â°]] and [[135th meridian east|135Â° E]]. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast width. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad [[grassland]]s predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]]. Other major rivers include the [[Xi River|Xi]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur River|Amur]]. To the west sit major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas. High [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]]. The world's highest point, [[Mount Everest]] (8,848m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nepal and China agree on Mount Everest's height|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8608913.stm|newspaper=BBC News|date=8 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country's lowest point, and the world's third-lowest, is the dried lake bed of [[Ayding Lake]] (âˆ’154m) in the [[Turpan Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lowest Places on Earth|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/naturescience/lowest-places-on-earth.htm|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China's climate is mainly dominated by [[dry season]]s and wet [[monsoons]], which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Regional Climate Studies of China|year=2008|publisher=Springer|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SEO_RyNDJ0gC&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=9783540792420}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's highly complex [[topography]].

These 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, and four municipalities can be collectively referred to as &quot;[[mainland China]]&quot;, a term which usually excludes the SARs of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]]. None of these divisions are recognized by the ROC government, which claims the entirety of the PRC's territory.

These claims are controversial because of the complicated [[Cross-Strait relations]], and has been [[One-China policy|one of the most important principles]] in Chinese diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.cultural-china.com/en/34History7320.html|title=Chinese Civil War|publisher=Cultural-China.com|quote=To this day, since no armistice or peace treaty has ever been signed, there is controversy as to whether the Civil War has legally ended.|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Taiwan, China is also involved in other international territorial disputes. Since the 1990s, China has been involved in negotiations to resolve its disputed land borders, including a [[Sino-Indian border dispute|disputed border with India]] and an undefined border with [[Bhutan]]. China is additionally involved in multilateral disputes over the ownership of several small islands in the East and South China Seas, such as the [[Senkaku Islands dispute|Senkaku Islands]] and the [[Scarborough Shoal standoff|Scarborough Shoal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18045383 &quot;China denies preparing war over South China Sea shoal&quot;].

The [[Chinese democracy movement]], social activists, and some members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need for social and political reform. While economic and social controls have been significantly relaxed in China since the 1970s, [[political freedom]] is still tightly restricted. The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] states that the &quot;fundamental rights&quot; of citizens include [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of religion]], [[universal suffrage]], and [[property|property rights]].

===Economic history and growth===
{{main article|Economic history of China (1949â€“present)}}
From its founding in 1949 until late 1978, the People's Republic of China was a Soviet-style centrally [[planned economy]]. Following Mao's death in 1976 and the consequent end of the [[Cultural Revolution]], [[Deng Xiaoping]] and the new Chinese leadership began to [[Economic reform in the People's Republic of China|reform the economy]] and move towards a more market-oriented [[mixed economy]] under one-party rule. [[Collective farming|Agricultural collectivization]] was dismantled and farmlands privatized, while foreign trade became a major new focus, leading to the creation of [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs). Inefficient [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) were restructured and unprofitable ones were closed outright, resulting in massive job losses. Modern-day China is mainly characterized as having a market economy based on private property ownership,&lt;ref name=&quot;english.eastday&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.eastday.com/e/ICS/u1a4035916.html |title=China is already a market economyâ€”Long Yongtu, Secretary General of Boao Forum for Asia|publisher=EastDay.com |year=2008 |accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the leading examples of [[state capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/ &quot;Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives&quot;].

China was a world leader in science and technology until the [[Ming Dynasty]]. Ancient [[List of Chinese discoveries|Chinese discoveries]] and [[List of Chinese inventions|inventions]], such as [[papermaking]], [[History of typography in East Asia|printing]], the [[compass]], and [[gunpowder]] (the [[Four Great Inventions]]), later became widespread in Asia and Europe. Chinese mathematicians were the first to use [[negative numbers#History|negative numbers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p003hyd9|title=In Our Time: Negative Numbers|publisher=BBC|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Struik, Dirk J. (1987). ''A Concise History of Mathematics''. New York: Dover Publications. p.32â€“33. &quot;''In these matrices we find negative numbers, which appear here for the first time in history.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 17th century, the Western world had surpassed China in scientific and technological development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chinese Studies in the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology |volume=179 |year=1996|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|pages=137â€“138 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jaQH6_8Ju-MC&amp;pg=PA137#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of this [[Great Divergence]] continue to be debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frank |first=Andre |authorlink=Andre Gunder Frank |title=Review of ''The Great Divergence'' |journal=Journal of Asian Studies |publisher=Cambridge University Press |volume=60 |issue=1 |year=2001 |pages=180â€“182 |doi=10.2307/2659525 |url=http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/agfrank/pomeranz.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After repeated military defeats by Western nations in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]].

Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]] and conservative philosophies. For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious [[imperial examination]]s, which have their origins in the [[Han Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=China: Understanding Its Past|year=1997|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chinese literature|literary emphasis]] of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[Classical Chinese poetry|poetry]] and [[Chinese painting|painting]] were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChinaFuture&quot; /&gt; Examinations and a [[meritocracy|culture of merit]] remain greatly valued in China today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Historical and Contemporary Exam-driven Education Fever in China|journal=KEDI Journal of Educational Policy|year=2005|volume=2|issue=1|pages=17â€“33 |url=http://suen.educ.psu.edu/~hsuen/pubs/KEDI%20Yu.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, [[sexism]], and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state. Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as &quot;regressive and harmful&quot; or &quot;vestiges of [[feudalism]]&quot;. Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as Confucianism, art, literature, and performing arts like [[Peking opera]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcded&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.cnta.gov.cn|title=Tour Guidebook: Beijing|publisher=China National Tourism Administration|accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time.

Located in the [[Pacific Ocean]], it lies to the east of the [[Sea of Japan]], the [[East China Sea]], [[China]], [[Korea]] and [[Russia]], stretching from the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the north to the East China Sea and [[Taiwan]] in the south. The [[kanji]] that make up [[Names of Japan|Japan's name]] mean &quot;sun origin&quot;, and it is often called the &quot;Land of the Rising Sun&quot;.

Japan is a [[Stratovolcano|stratovolcanic]] [[archipelago]] of [[List of islands of Japan|6,852 islands]]. The four largest are [[Honshu]], [[Hokkaido]], [[Kyushu]] and [[Shikoku]], which make up about ninety-seven percent of Japan's land area. The country is divided into 47 [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]] in eight [[List of regions of Japan|regions]]. The population of 126&amp;nbsp;million is the [[List of countries by population|world's tenth largest]]. [[Japanese people]] make up 98.5% of Japan's total population.

Archaeological research indicates that Japan was inhabited as early as the [[Upper Paleolithic]] period. The first written mention of Japan is in [[History of China|Chinese history]] texts from the 1st century AD. Influence from other regions, mainly [[Imperial China]], followed by periods of isolation, particularly from Western Europe, has characterized [[History of Japan|Japan's history]]. From the 12th century until 1868, Japan was ruled by successive feudal military [[shogun]]s who ruled in the name of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]]. Japan entered into a long period of isolation in the early 17th century, which was ended in 1853 when a United States fleet [[Bakumatsu|pressured Japan]] to open to the West. Nearly two decades of internal conflict and insurrection followed before the [[Emperor Meiji|Meiji Emperor]] was restored as head of state in 1868 and the [[Empire of Japan]] was proclaimed, with the Emperor as a divine symbol of the nation. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, victories in the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the [[Russo-Japanese War]] and [[World War I]] allowed Japan to expand its empire during a period of increasing militarism. The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] of 1937 expanded into part of [[World War II]] in 1941, which came to an [[End of World War II in Asia|end in 1945]] following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. Since adopting its revised [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] in 1947, Japan has maintained a unitary [[constitutional monarchy]] with an [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] and an elected legislature called the [[National Diet]].

Japan is a member of the [[United Nations|UN]], the [[Group of Seven (G7)|G7]], the [[Group of Eight (G8)|G8]], and the [[G-20 major economies|G20]] and is considered a [[great power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2015/01/04/the-seven-great-powers/|title=The Seven Great Powers|publisher=American-Interest|accessdate=July 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Balance of Power&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author1=T.

==Etymology==
{{Main article|Names of Japan}}

The English word ''Japan'' possibly derives from the early [[Mandarin Chinese]] or [[Wu Chinese]] pronunciation of the Japanese name, {{nihongo2|æ—¥æœ¬}}, which in Japanese is pronounced ''Nippon'' {{Audio|ja-nippon(æ—¥æœ¬).ogg|listen}} or ''Nihon'' {{Audio|ja-nihon(æ—¥æœ¬).ogg|listen}}. [[Japanese people]] refer to themselves as {{Nihongo4||æ—¥æœ¬äºº|Nihonjin}} and to their language as {{Nihongo4||æ—¥æœ¬èªž|Nihongo}}.

From the [[Meiji Restoration]] until the end of [[World War II]], the full title of Japan was {{nihongo4||å¤§æ—¥æœ¬å¸?åœ‹|Dai Nippon Teikoku}}, meaning &quot;the [[Empire of Japan|Empire of Great Japan]]&quot;. Today the name {{Nihongo4||æ—¥æœ¬å›½|Nippon-koku / Nihon-koku}} is used as a formal modern-day equivalent simply meaning &quot;the State of Japan&quot;; countries like Japan whose long form does not contain a descriptive designation are generally given a name appended by the character {{nihongo4||å›½|koku}}, meaning &quot;country&quot;, &quot;nation&quot; or &quot;state&quot;.

The character {{nihongo4||æ—¥|nichi}} means &quot;sun&quot; or &quot;day&quot;; {{nihongo4||æœ¬|hon}} means &quot;base&quot; or &quot;origin&quot;. The compound means &quot;origin of the sun&quot; or &quot;sunrise&quot; (from a Chinese point of view, the sun rises from Japan); it is a source for the popular Western description of Japan as the &quot;Land of the Rising Sun&quot;. Before ''Nihon'' came into official use, Japan was known as {{Nihongo4||å€­|[[Wa (Japan)|Wa]]}} or {{Nihongo4||å€­å›½|Wakoku}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The emergence of Japanese kingship|first=Joan R. |last=Piggott|year=1997|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=0-8047-2832-1|pages=143â€“144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word for Japan came to the West via [[Nanban trade|early trade routes]]. The [[Old Mandarin]] or possibly early Wu Chinese pronunciation of Japan was recorded by [[Marco Polo]] as ''Cipangu''. In modern [[Shanghainese]], a Wu dialect, the pronunciation of characters {{nihongo2|æ—¥æœ¬}} Japan is ''Zeppen'' {{IPA-wuu|zÉ™Ê”pÉ™n|}}. The old [[Malay language|Malay]] word for Japan, ''Jepang'', was borrowed from a southern coastal Chinese dialect, probably [[Hokkien|Fukienese]] or [[Ningbo dialect|Ningpo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boxer|first=Charles Ralph|title=The Christian century in Japan 1549â€“1650|year=1951|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=1-85754-035-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2R4DA2lip9gC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=The%20Christian%20Century%20In%20Japan%201549%E2%80%931650&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=japang&amp;f=false|pages=1â€“14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and this Malay word was encountered by [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] traders in [[Portuguese Malacca|Malacca]] in the 16th century. [[Portugal|Portuguese]] traders were the first to bring the word to [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;C. R.

The [[Nara period]] (710â€“784) of the 8th century marked an emergence of the centralized Japanese state centered on the Imperial Court in [[HeijÅ? Palace|HeijÅ?-kyÅ?]] (modern [[Nara, Nara|Nara]]). The [[Nara period]] is characterized by the appearance of a nascent [[Japanese literature|literature]] as well as the development of Buddhist-inspired art and [[Historic Monuments of Ancient Nara|architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Conrad|last=Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=64â€“79 | isbn=978-1-4051-2359-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[smallpox]] epidemic of 735â€“737 is believed to have killed as much as one-third of Japan's population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hays|first=J.N.|title=Epidemics and pandemics: their impacts on human history|year=2005|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=1-85109-658-2|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 784, [[Emperor Kanmu]] moved the capital from Nara to [[Nagaoka-kyÅ?]] before relocating it to [[Heian-kyÅ?]] (modern [[Kyoto]]) in 794.

This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]] (794â€“1185), during which a distinctly indigenous Japanese culture emerged, noted for its [[Japanese art|art]], [[Japanese poetry|poetry]] and prose. [[Murasaki Shikibu]]'s ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and the lyrics of Japan's national anthem ''[[Kimigayo]]'' were written during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Conrad|last=Totman |year=2002 |title=A History of Japan |publisher=Blackwell |pages=79â€“87, 122â€“123 | isbn=978-1-4051-2359-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddhism]] began to spread during the [[Heian era]] chiefly through two major sects, [[Tendai]] by [[SaichÅ?]], and [[Shingon]] by [[KÅ«kai]]. [[Pure Land Buddhism]] ([[JÅ?do-shÅ«]], [[JÅ?do ShinshÅ«]]) became greatly popular in the latter half of the 11th century.

===Feudal era===
[[File:MÅ?ko ShÅ«rai Ekotoba 2.jpg|thumb|Samurai warriors facing Mongols during the [[Mongol invasions of Japan]]; [[Takezaki Suenaga|Suenaga]], 1293]]

Japan's feudal era was characterized by the emergence and dominance of a ruling class of warriors, the [[samurai]]. In 1185, following the defeat of the [[Taira clan]] in the [[Genpei War]], sung in the epic [[The Tale of the Heike|Tale of Heike]], samurai [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] was appointed [[shogun]] by [[Emperor Go-Toba]], and he established a base of power in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]]. After his death, the [[HÅ?jÅ? clan]] came to power as regents for the shoguns. The [[Zen]] school of Buddhism was introduced from China in the [[Kamakura period]] (1185â€“1333) and became popular among the samurai class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2359-1|pages=106â€“112}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kamakura shogunate]] repelled [[Mongol invasions of Japan|Mongol invasions]] in 1274 and 1281, but was eventually [[Kenmu Restoration|overthrown by Emperor Go-Daigo]]. [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] was himself defeated by [[Ashikaga Takauji]] in 1336.

Ashikaga Takauji established the shogunate in Muromachi, [[Kyoto, Kyoto|Kyoto]]. This was the start of the [[Muromachi period]] (1336â€“1573). The [[Ashikaga shogunate]] achieved glory in the age of [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]], and the culture based on Zen Buddhism (art of ''[[Miyabi]]'') prospered. This evolved to [[Higashiyama period|Higashiyama Culture]], and prospered until the 16th century. On the other hand, the succeeding Ashikaga shogunate failed to control the feudal warlords (''[[daimyo]]''), and a civil war (the [[ÅŒnin War]]) began in 1467, opening the century-long [[Sengoku period]] (&quot;Warring States&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=George|last=Sansom |year=1961 |title=A History of Japan: 1334â€“1615 |publisher=Stanford University Press|pages=42, 217 | isbn=0-8047-0525-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 16th century, traders and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[missionary|missionaries]] from [[Portugal]] reached Japan for the first time, initiating direct [[Nanban trade|commercial]] and [[Nanban art|cultural]] exchange between Japan and the West. This allowed [[Oda Nobunaga]] to obtain European technology and firearms, which he used to conquer many other daimyo. His consolidation of power began what was known as the [[Azuchiâ€“Momoyama period]] (1573â€“1603). After he was assassinated in 1582, his successor [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] unified the nation in 1590 and launched [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592â€“98)|two unsuccessful invasions of Korea in 1592 and 1597]].

[[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] served as regent for Hideyoshi's [[Toyotomi Hideyori|son]] and used his position to gain political and military support. When open war broke out, he defeated rival clans in the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600. Tokugawa Ieyasu was appointed shogun by [[Emperor Go-YÅ?zei]] in 1603, and he established the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in [[Edo]] (modern [[Tokyo]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turnbull|first=Stephen|title=Toyotomi Hideyoshi|year=2010|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84603-960-7|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tokugawa shogunate enacted measures including ''[[buke shohatto]]'', as a code of conduct to control the autonomous daimyo;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2359-1|pages=142â€“143}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1639, the isolationist ''[[sakoku]]'' (&quot;closed country&quot;) policy that spanned the two and a half centuries of tenuous political unity known as the [[Edo period]] (1603â€“1868).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Toby|first=Ronald P.|title=Reopening the Question of Sakoku: Diplomacy in the Legitimation of the Tokugawa Bakufu|journal=Journal of Japanese Studies|year=1977|volume=3|issue=2|pages=323â€“363|doi=10.2307/132115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of Western sciences, known as ''[[rangaku]]'', continued through contact with the Dutch enclave at [[Dejima]] in [[Nagasaki]].

On March 31, 1854, [[Matthew C. Perry|Commodore Matthew Perry]] and the &quot;[[Black Ships]]&quot; of the [[United States Navy]] forced the opening of Japan to the outside world with the [[Convention of Kanagawa]]. Subsequent similar treaties with Western countries in the [[Bakumatsu]] period brought economic and political crises. The resignation of the shogun led to the [[Boshin War]] and the establishment of a [[Abolition of the han system|centralized state]] nominally unified under the Emperor (the [[Meiji Restoration]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2359-1|pages=289â€“296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adopting Western political, judicial and military institutions, the [[Cabinet of Japan|Cabinet]] organized the [[Privy Council (Japan)|Privy Council]], introduced the [[Meiji Constitution]], and assembled the [[National Diet|Imperial Diet]]. The Meiji Restoration transformed the [[Empire of Japan]] into an industrialized world power that pursued military conflict to expand its sphere of influence.

The early 20th century saw a brief period of &quot;[[TaishÅ? period|TaishÅ? democracy (1912-1926)]]&quot; but the 1920s saw a fragile democracy buckle under a political shift towards [[Statism in ShÅ?wa Japan|fascism]], the passing of [[Peace Preservation Law#Public Security Preservation Law of 1925|laws against political dissent]] and a series of attempted [[May 15 Incident|coups]]. The subsequent &quot;[[ShÅ?wa period]]&quot; initially saw the power of the military increased and brought about Japanese [[expansionism]] and [[Japanese militarism|militarization]] along with the totalitarianism and ultranationalism that are a part of fascist ideology. In 1931 Japan invaded and occupied [[Manchuria]] and following [[Lytton Report|international condemnation of this occupation]], Japan resigned from the [[League of Nations]] in 1933.

Japan is a [[constitutional monarchy]] whereby the power of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] is very limited. As a ceremonial figurehead, he is defined by the [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]] as &quot;the symbol of the State and of the unity of the people.&quot; Power is held chiefly by the [[Prime Minister of Japan|Prime Minister]] and other elected members of the Diet, while sovereignty is vested in the Japanese people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kantei.go.jp/foreign/constitution_and_government_of_japan/constitution_e.html |title=The Constitution of Japan |publisher=Prime Minister of Japan and His Cabinet |date=November 3, 1946 |accessdate=February 14, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Akihito]] is the current Emperor of Japan; [[Naruhito, Crown Prince of Japan]], stands as next in line to the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]].

Japan's legislative organ is the [[National Diet]], seated in [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], [[Tokyo]]. The Diet is a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] body, consisting of a [[House of Representatives (Japan)|House of Representatives]] with 480 seats, elected by popular vote every four years or when dissolved, and a [[House of Councillors (Japan)|House of Councillors]] of 242 seats, whose popularly elected members serve six-year terms.

The LDP has enjoyed near continuous electoral success since 1955, except for a brief 11-month period between 1993 and 1994, and from 2009 to 2012. It holds 294 seats in the lower house and 83 seats in the upper house.

The Prime Minister of Japan is the [[head of government]] and is [[Imperial Investiture|appointed]] by the Emperor after being designated by the Diet from among its members. The Prime Minister is the head of the Cabinet, and he appoints and dismisses the [[Minister of State|Ministers of State]]. Following the LDP's landslide victory in the [[Japanese general election, 2012|2012 general election]], [[ShinzÅ?

Although the Prime Minister is formally appointed by the Emperor, the Constitution of Japan explicitly requires the Emperor to appoint whoever is designated by the Diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;/&gt;

Japan's military (the [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]]) is restricted by [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution]], which renounces Japan's right to declare war or use military force in international disputes. Accordingly, Japan's Self-Defence force is a usual military that has never fired shots outside Japan.&lt;ref&gt;æ­£è«–, May 2014 (171).&lt;/ref&gt; It is governed by the [[Ministry of Defense (Japan)|Ministry of Defense]], and primarily consists of the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] (JGSDF), the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF) and the [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] (JASDF).

[[File:Japan topo en.jpg|thumb|Topographic map of the [[Japanese archipelago]]]]
Japan has a total of 6,852 islands extending along the [[Pacific coast]] of East Asia. The country, including all of the islands it controls, lies between latitudes 24Â° and 46Â°N, and longitudes 122Â° and 146Â°E. The main islands, from north to south, are [[Hokkaido]], [[Honshu]], [[Shikoku]] and [[Kyushu]]. The [[Ryukyu Islands]], which include [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]], are a chain to the south of [[Kyushu]]. Together they are often known as the [[Japanese archipelago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCargo|first=Duncan|title=Contemporary Japan|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-333-71000-2 |pages=8â€“11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 73 percent of Japan is forested, mountainous, and unsuitable for [[agriculture, forestry, and fishing in Japan|agricultural]], [[Manufacturing in Japan|industrial]], or [[Housing in Japan|residential]] use.&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/4142.htm|publisher=US Department of State|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the habitable zones, mainly located in coastal areas, have extremely high population densities. Japan is one of the [[list of countries by population density|most densely populated countries]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://esa.un.org/unpp/ |title=World Population Prospects |publisher=''[[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs]]'' |accessdate=March 27, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321013235/http://esa.un.org/unpp/ &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt; |archivedate=March 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The islands of Japan are located in a [[Volcano|volcanic]] zone on the [[Ring of Fire|Pacific Ring of Fire]]. They are primarily the result of large oceanic movements occurring over hundreds of millions of years from the mid-Silurian to the [[Pleistocene]] as a result of the [[subduction]] of the [[Philippine Sea Plate]] beneath the continental [[Amurian Plate]] and [[Okinawa Plate]] to the south, and subduction of the [[Pacific Plate]] under the [[Okhotsk Plate]] to the north. Japan was originally attached to the eastern coast of the Eurasian continent. The subducting plates pulled Japan eastward, opening the [[Sea of Japan]] around 15 million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shinku.nichibun.ac.jp/jpub/pdf/jr/IJ1501.pdf|last=Barnes|first=Gina L.|title=Origins of the Japanese Islands|publisher=[[University of Durham]]|year=2003|accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan has 108 active volcanoes. During the twentieth century several new volcanoes emerged, including [[ShÅ?wa-shinzan]] on Hokkaido and [[MyÅ?jin-shÅ?]] off the [[Bayonnaise Rocks]] in the Pacific.

The climate of Japan is predominantly temperate, but varies greatly from north to south. Japan's geographical features divide it into six principal climatic zones: [[Hokkaido]], [[Sea of Japan]], [[Central Highland (Japan)|Central Highland]], [[Seto Inland Sea]], [[Pacific Ocean]], and [[Ryukyu Islands]]. The northernmost zone, Hokkaido, has a [[humid continental climate]] with long, cold winters and very warm to cool summers. [[precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] is not heavy, but the islands usually develop deep snowbanks in the winter.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite book|last=Karan|first=Pradyumna Prasad|title=Japan in the 21st century|year=2005|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0-8131-2342-9|pages=18â€“21, 41|author2=Gilbreath, Dick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Sea of Japan zone on Honshu's west coast, northwest winter winds bring heavy snowfall. In the summer, the region is cooler than the Pacific area, though it sometimes experiences extremely hot temperatures because of the [[foehn wind|foehn]]. The Central Highland has a typical inland humid continental climate, with large temperature differences between summer and winter seasons, as well as large diurnal variation; precipitation is light, though winters are usually snowy. The mountains of the [[ChÅ«goku region|ChÅ«goku]] and [[Shikoku]] regions shelter the [[Seto Inland Sea]] from seasonal winds, bringing mild weather year-round.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The Pacific coast features a [[humid subtropical]] climate that experiences milder winters with occasional snowfall and hot, humid summers because of the southeast seasonal wind. The Ryukyu Islands have a [[subtropics|subtropical climate]], with warm winters and hot summers. Precipitation is very heavy, especially during the rainy season.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In the period of rapid economic growth after [[World War II]], environmental policies were downplayed by the government and industrial corporations; as a result, [[Four Big Pollution Diseases of Japan|environmental pollution]] was widespread in the 1950s and 1960s.

Some of the surviving elements of the Edo period are [[KaidÅ?|roads]] and water transportation routes, as well as financial instruments such as [[futures contract]]s, banking and insurance of the [[Osaka rice brokers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Origins of Japanese Trade Supremacy |author=Howe, Christopher |publisher=Hurst &amp; Company |year=1996 |isbn=1-85065-538-3|pages=58f}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Meiji period from 1868, Japan expanded economically with the embrace of the [[market economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2359-1|pages=312â€“314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of today's enterprises were founded at the time, and Japan emerged as the most developed nation in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCargo|first=Duncan|title=Contemporary Japan|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=0-333-71000-2 |pages=18â€“19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period of overall real economic growth from the 1960s to the 1980s has been called the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle]]: it averaged 7.5 percent in the 1960s and 1970s, and 3.2 percent in the 1980s and early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryan|first=Liam|title=The &quot;Asian economic  miracle&quot; unmasked: The political economy of the reality|journal=International Journal of Social Economics|date=January 1, 2000|volume=27|issue=7â€“10|pages=802â€“815|doi=10.1108/03068290010335235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growth slowed in the 1990s during [[Lost Decade (Japan)|the &quot;Lost Decade&quot;]] due to after-effects of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] and government policies intended to wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Efforts to revive economic growth were unsuccessful and further hampered by the [[Dot-com bubble|global slowdown in 2000]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; The economy recovered after 2005; GDP growth for that year was 2.8 percent, surpassing the growth rates of the US and [[European Union]] during the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Masake|first=Hisane|title=A farewell to zero|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Japan/HC02Dh01.html|accessdate=January 16, 2011|newspaper=Asia Times|date=March 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Japan, health care is provided by national and local governments. Payment for personal medical services is offered through a universal health insurance system that provides relative equality of access, with fees set by a government committee. People without insurance through employers can participate in a national health insurance program administered by local governments. Since 1973, all elderly persons have been covered by government-sponsored insurance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyu.edu/projects/rodwin/lessons.html |first=Victor|last=Rodwin|title=Health Care in Japan |publisher=New York University |accessdate=March 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients are free to select the physicians or facilities of their choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipss.go.jp/s-info/e/Jasos/Health.html |title=Health Insurance: General Characteristics |publisher=National Institute of Population and Social Security Research |accessdate=March 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interaction between Japanese and European art has been significant: for example [[ukiyo-e]] prints, which began to be exported in the 19th century in the movement known as [[Japonism]], had a significant influence on the development of modern art in the West, most notably on [[post-Impressionism]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Famous ukiyo-e artists include [[Hokusai]] and [[Hiroshige]]. Hokusai coined the term [[manga]]. Japanese comics now known as manga developed in the 20th century and have become popular worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kinko Ito|title=A History of Manga in the Context of Japanese Culture and Society|journal=Journal of Popular Culture|volume=38|issue=3|pages=456â€“475|date=February 2005|doi=10.1111/j.0022-3840.2005.00123.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese animation is called [[anime]].

===Music===
{{Main article|Music of Japan}}
Japanese music is eclectic and diverse. Many [[Traditional Japanese musical instruments|instruments]], such as the [[koto (instrument)|koto]], were introduced in the 9th and 10th centuries. The accompanied [[recitative]] of the [[Noh]] drama dates from the 14th century and the popular [[Music of Japan#Folk music|folk music]], with the guitar-like [[shamisen]], from the sixteenth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Malm|first=William P.|title=Traditional Japanese music and musical instruments|year=2000|publisher=Kodansha International|isbn=978-4-7700-2395-7|pages=31â€“45|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western classical music, introduced in the late 19th century, now forms an integral part of Japanese culture. The imperial court ensemble [[Gagaku]] has influenced the work of some [[20th-century classical music|modern]] Western composers.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, [[Olivier Messiaen]], ''Sept haÃ¯kaÃ¯'' (1962),  (''Olivier Messiaen: a research and information guide'', Routledge, 2008, By Vincent Perez Benitez, page 67) and (''Messiaen the Theologian'', Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2010, page&amp;nbsp;243â€“65, By Andrew Shenton)&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable classical composers from Japan include [[Toru Takemitsu]] and [[RentarÅ? Taki]]. Popular music in post-war Japan has been heavily influenced by American and European trends, which has led to the evolution of [[J-pop]], or Japanese popular music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/aug/21/popandrock3 |title= J-Pop History |work=The Observer | accessdate=April 1, 2007 | first=Chris | last=Campion | date=August 22, 2005 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karaoke]] is the most widely practiced cultural activity in Japan. A 1993 survey by the [[Agency for Cultural Affairs|Cultural Affairs Agency]] found that more Japanese had sung karaoke that year than had participated in traditional pursuits such as flower arranging (ikebana) or tea ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The worlds of Japanese popular culture: gender, shifting boundaries and global cultures|year=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-63729-9|page=76|edition=Repr.|editor=Martinez, D.P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest works of Japanese literature include the ''[[Kojiki]]'' and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' chronicles and the ''[[Man'yÅ?shÅ«]]'' [[List of Japanese poetry anthologies|poetry anthology]], all from the 8th century and written in Chinese characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Seeds in the Heart: Japanese Literature from Earliest Times to the Late Sixteenth Century |author=Keene, Donald |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-231-11441-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/~ascj/2000/200015.htm |title= Asian Studies Conference, Japan (2000) |publisher=Meiji Gakuin University |accessdate=April 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early Heian period, the system of [[Phonogram (linguistics)|phonograms]] known as ''kana'' ([[Hiragana]] and [[Katakana]]) was developed. ''[[The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter]]'' is considered the oldest Japanese narrative.&lt;ref name=&quot;ispmsu&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://isp.msu.edu/AsianStudies/wbwoa/eastasia/Japan/literature.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011065654/http://isp.msu.edu/AsianStudies/wbwoa/eastasia/Japan/literature.html |archivedate=October 11, 2007 |title= Windows on Asiaâ€”Literature : Antiquity to Middle Ages: Recent Past |publisher=Michigan State University |accessdate=December 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; An account of Heian court life is given in ''[[The Pillow Book]]'' by [[Sei ShÅ?nagon]], while ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' by [[Murasaki Shikibu]] is often described as the world's first novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Totman|first=Conrad|title=A History of Japan ''(2nd ed.)''|year=2005|publisher=Blackwell|isbn=1-4051-2359-1|pages=126â€“127}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Tale of Genji|editor=Royall, Tyler|publisher=[[Penguin Classics]]|year=2003|isbn=0-14-243714-X|pages=iâ€“ii, xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Edo period, the [[chÅ?nin]] (&quot;townspeople&quot;) overtook the samurai aristocracy as producers and consumers of literature. The popularity of the works of [[Saikaku]], for example, reveals this change in readership and authorship, while [[Matsuo BashÅ?|BashÅ?]] revivified the poetic tradition of the [[KokinshÅ«]] with his [[haikai]] ([[haiku]]) and wrote the poetic travelogue ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=World Within Walls: Japanese Literature of the Pre-Modern Era, 1600â€“1867 |author=Keene, Donald |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-231-11467-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Meiji era saw the decline of traditional literary forms as Japanese literature integrated Western influences. [[Natsume SÅ?seki]] and [[Mori ÅŒgai]] were the first &quot;modern&quot; novelists of Japan, followed by [[RyÅ«nosuke Akutagawa]], [[Jun'ichirÅ? Tanizaki]], [[Yukio Mishima]] and, more recently, [[Haruki Murakami]]. Japan has two [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize-winning]] authorsâ€”[[Yasunari Kawabata]] (1968) and [[KenzaburÅ?

===Cuisine===
[[File:Breakfast at Tamahan Ryokan, Kyoto.jpg|thumb|right|Breakfast at a ''[[Ryokan (Japanese inn)|ryokan]]'' or inn]]
{{Main article|Japanese cuisine}}
Japanese cuisine is based on combining [[staple food]]s, typically [[Japanese rice]] or [[Japanese noodles|noodles]], with a soup and ''[[okazu]]''&amp;nbsp;â€” dishes made from [[Fish (food)|fish]], vegetable, [[tofu]] and the like&amp;nbsp;â€“ to add flavor to the staple food. In the early modern era ingredients such as red meats that had previously not been widely used in Japan were introduced. Japanese cuisine is known for its emphasis on [[Seasonal food|seasonality of food]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tjf.or.jp/eng/content/japaneseculture/pdf/ge09shun.pdf &quot;A Day in the Life: Seasonal Foods&quot;], The Japan Forum Newsletter No.September 14, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; quality of ingredients and presentation. Japanese cuisine offers a vast array of [[Japanese regional cuisine|regional specialties]] that use traditional recipes and local ingredients. The [[Michelin Guide]] has awarded restaurants in Japan more Michelin stars than the rest of the world combined.&lt;ref name=michelin20101124&gt;{{cite web|script-title=ja:ã€ŒãƒŸã‚·ãƒ¥ãƒ©ãƒ³ã‚¬ã‚¤ãƒ‰æ?±äº¬ãƒ»æ¨ªæµœãƒ»éŽŒå€‰2011ã€?ã‚’ç™ºè¡Œã€€ä¸‰ã?¤æ˜Ÿã?Œ14è»’ã€? äºŒã?¤æ˜Ÿã?Œ54è»’ã€?ä¸€ã?¤æ˜Ÿã?Œ198è»’ã?«|url=http://web-cache.stream.ne.jp/www09/michelin/guide/tokyo/|publisher=Michelin Japan|accessdate=February 7, 2011|date=November 24, 2010|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Palazzo Ferreria statue 2.jpeg|thumb|Statue representing Africa at [[Palazzo Ferreria]], in [[Valletta]], [[Malta]]]]
''[[Afri]]'' was a [[Latin]] name used to refer to the inhabitants of Africa, which in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the Mediterranean ([[Ancient Libya]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Georges|first1=Karl Ernst|editor1-last=Georges|editor1-first=Heinrich|encyclopedia=AusfÃ¼hrliches lateinisch-deutsches HandwÃ¶rterbuch|date=1913â€“1918|location=Hannover|edition=8th|url=http://latin_german.deacademic.com/1644|accessdate=20 September 2015|language=German|title=Afri}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Lewis|first1=Charlton T.|last2=Short|first2=Charles|encyclopedia=A Latin Dictionary|date=1879|publisher=Clarendon Press|location=Oxford|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3DAfer|accessdate=20 September 2015|title=Afer}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name seems to have originally referred to a native [[Ancient Libya|Libyan]] tribe; see [[Terence#Biography]] for discussion. The name is usually connected with [[Biblical Hebrew|Hebrew]] or [[Phoenician language|Phoenician]] ''{{lang|phn|Ê¿afar''}} 'dust', but a 1981 hypothesis&lt;ref&gt;[http://michel-desfayes.org/namesofcountries.html Names of countries], Decret and Fantar, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; has asserted that it stems from the [[Berber languages|Berber]] ''ifri'' (plural ''ifran'') &quot;cave&quot;, in reference to cave dwellers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michell&quot;&gt;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/714549 Geo. Babington Michell, &quot;The Berbers&quot;], ''Journal of Royal African Society'', Vol. 2, No. 6 (January 1903), pp. 161-194.&lt;/ref&gt; The same word&lt;ref name=Michell/&gt; may be found in the name of the [[Banu Ifran]] from [[Algeria]] and [[Tripolitania]], a [[Berber people|Berber]] tribe originally from [[Yafran]] (also known as ''Ifrane'') in northwestern Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SLSzNfdcqfoC&amp;pg=PA200 Edward Lipinski, ''Itineraria Phoenicia''], Peeters Publishers, 2004, p. 200. ISBN 90-429-1344-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule, Carthage became the capital of the province of [[Africa Proconsularis]], which also included the coastal part of modern [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultsos.com/pandora/africa.htm|title=Consultos.com etymology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin suffix &quot;[[wikt:-ica#Latin|-ica]]&quot; can sometimes be used to denote a land (e.g., in ''[[Celtica]]'' from ''[[Celts|Celtae]]'', as used by [[Julius Caesar]]). The later Muslim kingdom of [[Ifriqiya]], modern-day Tunisia, also preserved a form of the name.

According to the Romans, Africa lay to the west of Egypt, while &quot;Asia&quot; was used to refer to [[Anatolia]] and lands to the east. A definite line was drawn between the two continents by the geographer [[Ptolemy]] (85â€“165 AD), indicating [[Alexandria]] along the [[Prime Meridian]] and making the isthmus of Suez and the [[Red Sea]] the boundary between Asia and Africa. As Europeans came to understand the real extent of the continent, the idea of &quot;Africa&quot; expanded with their knowledge.

Other etymological hypotheses have been postulated for the ancient name &quot;Africa&quot;:
* The 1st-century Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]] (''Ant. 1.15'') asserted that it was named for [[Epher]], grandson of [[Abraham]] according to Gen. 25:4, whose descendants, he claimed, had invaded Libya.
* [[Isidore of Seville]] in ''[[Etymologiae]]'' XIV.5.2. suggests &quot;Africa comes from the [[Latin]] ''aprica'', meaning &quot;sunny&quot;.
* Massey, in 1881, stated that Africa is derived from the Egyptian ''af-rui-ka'', meaning &quot;to turn toward the opening of the Ka.&quot; The [[Egyptian soul#Ka|Ka]] is the energetic double of every person and the &quot;opening of the Ka&quot; refers to a womb or birthplace. Africa would be, for the Egyptians, &quot;the birthplace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gerald-massey.org.uk/massey/cmc_nile_genesis.htm|title='Nile Genesis: the opus of Gerald Massey'|publisher=Gerald-massey.org.uk|date=29 October 1907|accessdate=18 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* MichÃ¨le Fruyt proposed&lt;ref&gt;in ''Revue de Philologie'' 50, 1976: pp. 221â€“238.&lt;/ref&gt; linking the Latin word with ''africus'' &quot;south wind&quot;, which would be of Umbrian origin and mean originally &quot;rainy wind&quot;.
* Robert R. Stieglitz of [[Rutgers University]] proposed: &quot;The name Africa, derived from the Latin *Aphir-ic-a, is cognate to Hebrew [[Ophir]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Long-Distance Seafaring in the Ancient Near East.&quot; Robert R.

Africa is considered by most [[paleoanthropology|paleoanthropologists]] to be the [[cradle of Humankind|oldest inhabited territory]] on [[Earth]], with the [[Human|human species]] originating from the continent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/1058484.stm Genetic study roots humans in Africa], BBC News, SCI/TECH&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/08/070828155004.htm Migration of Early Humans From Africa Aided By Wet Weather], sciencedaily.com&lt;/ref&gt; During the mid-20th century, [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] discovered many [[fossil]]s and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago (BP=before present). Fossil remains of several species of early apelike humans thought to have [[Evolution|evolved]] into modern man, such as ''[[Australopithecus afarensis]]'' ([[Radiometric dating|radiometrically dated]] to approximately 3.9â€“3.0&amp;nbsp;million years BP,&lt;ref&gt;Kimbel, William H. and Yoel Rak and Donald C.

Other migrations of modern humans within the African continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in [[Southern Africa]], [[Southeast Africa]], [[North Africa]], and the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;Candice Goucher et al., World History: Journeys from Past to Present (2013), pp. 2-20 [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1134723547]&lt;/ref&gt;

The size of the [[Sahara]] has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climactic conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1317970012 The Sahara: Past, Present and Future, pp. 1-41]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the [[Ice age]]s, estimated to have been around 10,500 BC, the Sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its African populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], with rock art paintings depicting a fertile Sahara and large populations discovered in [[Tassili n'Ajjer]] dating back perhaps 10 millennia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mercier|first1=Norbert|author2=et. al.|date=2012|title=OSL dating of quaternary deposits associated with the parietal art of the Tassili-n-Ajjer plateau (Central Sahara)|journal=Quaternary Geochronology|volume=10|pages=367â€“373|doi=10.1016/j.quageo.2011.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 BC, the Sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. Around 3500 BC, due to a tilt in the earth's orbit, the Sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1999/07/990712080500.ht &quot;Sahara's Abrupt Desertification Started by Changes in Earth's Orbit, Accelerated by Atmospheric and Vegetation Feedbacks&quot;], ''Science Daily''&lt;/ref&gt; The population trekked out of the Sahara region towards the Nile Valley below the [[Cataracts of the Nile|Second Cataract]] where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. A major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in Central and [[East Africa|Eastern Africa]]. Since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in Eastern Africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in [[Ethiopia]].

The domestication of [[cattle]] in Africa preceded [[agriculture]] and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. It is speculated that by 6000 BC, cattle were domesticated in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. (1999) &quot;Guns, Germs and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. New York:Norton, p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sahara-Nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the [[donkey]] and a small screw-horned goat which was common from [[Algeria]] to [[Nubia]].

Around 4000 BC, the Saharan climate started to become drier at an exceedingly fast pace.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot;&gt;O'Brien, Patrick K. (General Editor). ''Oxford Atlas of World History''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 22â€“23&lt;/ref&gt; This climate change caused lakes and rivers to shrink significantly and caused increasing [[desertification]]. This, in turn, decreased the amount of land conducive to settlements and helped to cause migrations of farming communities to the more tropical climate of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot;/&gt;

By the first millennium BC, [[Ferrous metallurgy|ironworking]] had been introduced in Northern Africa and quickly spread across the Sahara into the northern parts of sub-Saharan Africa,&lt;ref&gt;[http://princetonol.com/groups/iad/lessons/middle/history1.htm#Irontechnology Martin and O'Meara, &quot;Africa, 3rd Ed.&quot;] Indiana: Indiana University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and by 500 BC, metalworking began to become commonplace in West Africa. Ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 BC in many areas of East and West Africa, although other regions didn't begin ironworking until the early centuries AD. [[Copper]] objects from [[Egypt]], North Africa, Nubia, and Ethiopia dating from around 500 BC have been excavated in West Africa, suggesting that [[Trans-Saharan trade]] networks had been established by this date.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot;/&gt;

Following the conquest of North Africa's Mediterranean coastline by the [[Roman Empire]], the area was integrated economically and culturally into the Roman system. [[Africa Province|Roman settlement]] occurred in modern Tunisia and elsewhere along the coast.

In the early 7th century, the newly formed Arabian Islamic [[Caliphate]] expanded into Egypt, and then into North Africa. In a short while, the local Berber elite had been integrated into Muslim Arab tribes. When the Umayyad capital Damascus fell in the 8th century, the Islamic center of the Mediterranean shifted from Syria to [[Qayrawan]] in North Africa. Islamic North Africa had become diverse, and a hub for mystics, scholars, jurists, and philosophers. During the above-mentioned period, Islam spread to sub-Saharan Africa, mainly through trade routes and migration.&lt;ref name =Ayoub&gt;{{cite book|last=Ayoub|first=Mahmoud M.|authorlink=Mahmoud M.

These included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the [[San people]] of southern Africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Bantu peoples|peoples]] of central, southern, and eastern Africa; heavily structured clan groups in the [[Horn of Africa]]; the large [[Sahelian kingdoms]]; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the [[Akan people|Akan]]; [[Benin Empire|Edo]], [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]], and [[Igbo people]] in [[West Africa]]; and the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coastal trading towns of [[Southeast Africa]].

By the ninth century AD, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] states, stretched across the sub-Saharan savannah from the western regions to central Sudan.

Sonni Ali seized [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 and [[DjennÃ©|Jenne]] in 1473, building his regime on trade revenues and the cooperation of Muslim merchants. His successor [[Askia Mohammad I]] (1493â€“1528) made Islam the official religion, built mosques, and brought to Gao Muslim scholars, including al-Maghili (d.1504), the founder of an important tradition of Sudanic African Muslim scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;multiple&quot;&gt;Ira M. Lapidus, ''A History of Islamic Societies'', Cambridge, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; By the eleventh century, some [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa]] states â€“ such as [[Kano]], [[jigawa]], [[Katsina]], and [[Gobir]] â€“ had developed into walled towns engaging in trade, servicing [[camel train|caravans]], and the manufacture of goods. Until the fifteenth century, these small states were on the periphery of the major Sudanic empires of the era, paying tribute to Songhai to the west and Kanem-Borno to the east.

In [[West Africa]], the decline of the Atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. The gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the [[New World]], increasing [[abolitionism|anti-slavery]] legislation in Europe and America, and the [[Royal Navy|British Royal Navy's]] increasing presence off the West African coast, obliged African states to adopt new economies. Between 1808 and 1860, the British [[West Africa Squadron]] seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 Africans who were aboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/03/20/abolition_navy_feature.shtml Jo Loosemore, Sailing against slavery].

Action was also taken against African leaders who refused to agree to British treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against &quot;the usurping King of [[Lagos]]&quot;, deposed in 1851. Anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 African rulers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm#WAS|title=The West African Squadron and slave trade|publisher=Pdavis.nl|accessdate=18 May 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610030306/http://www.pdavis.nl/Background.htm|archivedate=10 June 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest powers of West Africa (the [[Asante Confederacy]], the [[Dahomey|Kingdom of Dahomey]], and the [[Oyo Empire]]) adopted different ways of adapting to the shift. Asante and Dahomey concentrated on the development of &quot;legitimate commerce&quot; in the form of [[palm oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], [[timber]] and [[gold]], forming the bedrock of West Africa's modern export trade. The Oyo Empire, unable to adapt, collapsed into civil wars.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, Julian L. (1995) ''State of Humanity'', Blackwell Publishing. p. 175. ISBN 1-55786-585-X&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century, the European [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers engaged in a major territorial scramble and occupied most of the continent, creating many [[colony|colonial]] territories, and leaving only two fully independent states: [[Ethiopia]] (known to Europeans as &quot;Abyssinia&quot;), and [[Liberia]]. [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]] were never formally incorporated into any European colonial empire; however, after the British occupation of 1882, Egypt &lt;!-- the fate of Sudan and its administrative status under British rule differed from those of Egypt --&gt;was effectively under British administration [[Unilateral Declaration of Egyptian Independence|until 1922]].

===Berlin Conference===
The [[Berlin Conference]] held in 1884â€“85 was an important event in the political future of African ethnic groups. It was convened by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]], and attended by the European powers that laid claim to African territories. It sought to end the European powers' Scramble for Africa, by agreeing on political division and spheres of influence. They set up the political divisions of the continent, by spheres of interest, that exist in Africa today.

===Independence struggles===
Imperial rule by Europeans would continue until after the conclusion of [[World War II]], when almost all remaining colonial territories gradually obtained formal independence. [[African independence movements|Independence movements in Africa]] gained momentum following World War II, which left the major European powers weakened. In 1951, [[Libya]], a former Italian colony, gained independence. In 1956, [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]] won their independence from France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Ltzav890zpIC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=tunisia+morocco+independance+1956#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Lucien BÃ©ly, ''History of France''.

Most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.

Portugal's overseas presence in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (most notably in [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], Cape Verde, [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]], [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea-Bissau]] and SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe) lasted from the 16th century to 1975, after the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime was overthrown in [[Carnation Revolution|a military coup in Lisbon]]. [[Rhodesia]] [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|unilaterally declared independence]] from the [[United Kingdom]] in 1965, under the [[White minority rule|white minority]] government of [[Ian Smith]], but was not internationally recognized as an independent state (as [[Zimbabwe]]) until 1980, when black nationalists gained power after a [[Rhodesian Bush War|bitter guerrilla war]]. Although [[South Africa]] was one of the first African countries to gain independence, the state remained under the control of the country's white minority through a system of racial segregation known as [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] until 1994.

===Post-colonial Africa===
[[File:Mobutu Sese Seko 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], [[Zaire]]'s longtime dictator, [[Embezzlement|embezzled]] over $5 billion from his country.]]
Today, Africa contains 54 sovereign countries, most of which have borders that were drawn during the era of European colonialism. Since colonialism, African states have frequently been hampered by instability, corruption, violence, and [[authoritarianism]]. The vast majority of African states are [[republic]]s that operate under some form of the [[presidential system]] of rule. However, few of them have been able to sustain [[Democracy|democratic]] governments on a permanent basis, and many have instead cycled through a series of [[Coup d'Ã©tat|coups]], producing [[military dictatorship]]s.

Great instability was mainly the result of [[Ethnic nepotism|marginalization of ethnic groups]], and [[Political corruption|graft under these leaders]]. For [[Divide and rule|political gain]], many leaders fanned ethnic conflicts, some of which had been exacerbated, or even created, by colonial rule. In many countries, the [[Armed forces|military]] was perceived as being the only group that could effectively maintain order, and it ruled many nations in Africa during the 1970s and early 1980s. During the period from the early 1960s to the late 1980s, Africa had more than 70 coups and 13 presidential [[assassination]]s. Border and territorial disputes were also common, with the European-imposed borders of many nations being widely contested through armed conflicts.
[[File:SADF-Operations 4.jpg|thumb|South African paratroops on a raid in Angola during the [[South African Border War]]]]
[[Cold War]] conflicts between the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], as well as the policies of the [[International Monetary Fund]],{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} also played a role in instability. When a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two [[superpower]]s. Many countries in [[Northern Africa]] received Soviet military aid, while others in Central and Southern Africa were supported by the United States, France or both. The 1970s saw an escalation of Cold War intrigues, as newly independent [[Angola]] and [[Mozambique]] aligned themselves with the Soviet Union, and the West and South Africa sought to contain Soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. In [[Rhodesia]], Soviet and Chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the [[Patriotic Front (Zimbabwe)|Zimbabwe Patriotic Front]] waged a brutal [[Rhodesian Bush War|guerrilla war]] against the country's white government. There was a [[1983â€“85 famine in Ethiopia|major famine in Ethiopia]], when hundreds of thousands of people starved. Some claimed that Marxist economic policies made the situation worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/703958.stm|title=BBC: 1984 famine in Ethiopia|date=6 April 2000|accessdate=1 January 2010|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert G.

Another notable tragic event is the 1994 [[Rwandan Genocide]] in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered. [[HIV/AIDS in Africa|AIDS in post-colonial Africa]] has also been a prevalent issue.

In the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in Africa has steadily declined. For instance, the [[Angolan Civil War|civil war in Angola]] came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. This has coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. The improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many African nations, mainly from [[China]],&lt;ref name=Africa/&gt; which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. Several African economies are among the world's fastest growing as of 2016. A significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as [[Africa Rising]], can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Aker, Isaac Mbiti, [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1693963 &quot;Mobile Phones and Economic Development in Africa&quot;] SSRN&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main article|Climate of Africa}}
[[File:Africa map of KÃ¶ppen climate classification.svg|thumb|Africa map of KÃ¶ppen climate classification]]
The climate of Africa ranges from [[tropical climate|tropical]] to [[subarctic]] on its highest peaks. Its northern half is primarily [[desert]], or [[arid]], while its central and southern areas contain both [[savanna]] plains and dense [[jungle]] ([[rainforest]]) regions. In between, there is a convergence, where vegetation patterns such as [[sahel]] and [[steppe]] dominate. Africa is the hottest continent on earth and 60% of the entire land surface consists of drylands and deserts.&lt;ref name=&quot;environmentalatlas&quot;&gt;[http://www.africa.upenn.edu/afrfocus/afrfocus061708.html &quot;Africa: Environmental Atlas, 06/17/08.&quot;] [http://www.africa.upenn.edu African Studies Center], University of Pennsylvania.

===Fauna===
{{Main article|Fauna of Africa}}
[[File:Zebras, Serengeti savana plains, Tanzania.jpg|left|thumb|Savanna at [[Ngorongoro Conservation Area]], [[Tanzania]]]]
Africa boasts perhaps the world's largest combination of density and &quot;range of freedom&quot; of [[wild animal]] populations and diversity, with wild populations of large [[carnivore]]s (such as [[lion]]s, [[hyena]]s, and [[cheetah]]s) and [[herbivore]]s (such as [[African buffalo|buffalo]], [[elephant]]s, [[camel]]s, and [[giraffe]]s) ranging freely on primarily open non-private plains. It is also home to a variety of &quot;jungle&quot; animals including [[snake]]s and [[primate]]s and [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic life]] such as [[crocodile]]s and [[amphibian]]s. In addition, Africa has the largest number of [[megafauna]] species, as it was least affected by the [[Quaternary extinction event#The Pleistocene or Ice Age extinction event|extinction of the Pleistocene megafauna]].

===Ecology and biodiversity===
[[File:Mauritius beach.png|thumb||Tropical beach in [[Trou-aux-Biches]], [[Mauritius]]]]
[[Deforestation]] is affecting Africa at twice the world rate, according to the United Nations Environment Programme ([[UNEP]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.africanews.com/site/list_messages/18831 Deforestation reaches worrying level â€“ UN]. AfricaNews. 11 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; According to the University of Pennsylvania African Studies Center, 31% of Africa's pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and Africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;environmentalatlas&quot;/&gt; Some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in [[West Africa]] have been destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/features/10278 Forests and deforestation in Africa â€“ the wasting of an immense resource]. afrol News&lt;/ref&gt; Over 90% of [[Madagascar]]'s original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{NatGeo ecoregion|id=at0118|name=Madagascar subhumid forests}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 65% of Africa's agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/nature-laid-waste-the-destruction-of-africa-844370.html &quot;Nature laid waste: The destruction of Africa&quot;], ''The Independent'', 11 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Africa has over 3,000 [[protected area]]s, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. Significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing Africa's biological diversity. Human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in Africa. This has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;environmentalatlas&quot;/&gt;

There are clear signs of increased networking among African organizations and states. For example, in the civil war in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (former [[Zaire]]), rather than rich, non-African countries intervening, neighboring African countries became involved (see also [[Second Congo War]]). Since the conflict began in 1998, the estimated death toll has reached 5 million.

===The African Union===
[[File:Map of the African Union with Suspended States.svg|thumb|upright|Map of the African Union with suspended states highlighted in light green]]
{{Main article|African Union}}
The [[African Union]] (AU) is a 54-member federation consisting of all of Africa's states except [[Morocco]]. The union was formed, with [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]], as its headquarters, on 26 June 2001. The union was officially established on 9 July 2002&lt;ref name=&quot;African Union 2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africa-union.org/official_documents/Speeches_&amp;_Statements/HE_Thabo_Mbiki/Launch%20of%20the%20African%20Union,%209%20July%202002.htm|title=Launch of the African Union, 9 July 2002: Address by the chairperson of the AU, President Thabo Mbeki|author=Thabo Mbeki|date=9 July 2002|publisher=africa-union.org|location=ABSA Stadium, Durban, South Africa|accessdate=8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a successor to the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). In July 2004, the African Union's [[Pan-African Parliament]] (PAP) was relocated to [[Midrand]], in South Africa, but the [[African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights]] remained in Addis Ababa. There is a policy in effect to decentralize the African Federation's institutions so that they are shared by all the states.

The African Union, not to be confused with the AU Commission, is formed by the [[Constitutive Act of the African Union]], which aims to transform the [[African Economic Community]], a federated commonwealth, into a state under established international conventions. The African Union has a parliamentary government, known as the [[Assembly of the African Union|African Union Government]], consisting of legislative, judicial and executive organs. It is led by the African Union President and Head of State, who is also the President of the [[Pan-African Parliament]]. A person becomes AU President by being elected to the PAP, and subsequently gaining majority support in the PAP. The powers and authority of the President of the African Parliament derive from the Constitutive Act and the [[Pan-African Parliament|Protocol of the Pan-African Parliament]], as well as the inheritance of presidential authority stipulated by African treaties and by international treaties, including those subordinating the Secretary General of the [[OAU]] Secretariat (AU Commission) to the PAP. The government of the AU consists of all-union (federal), regional, state, and municipal authorities, as well as hundreds of institutions, that together manage the day-to-day affairs of the institution.

Political associations such as the African Union offer hope for greater co-operation and peace between the continent's many countries. Extensive human rights abuses still occur in several parts of Africa, often under the oversight of the state. Most of such violations occur for political reasons, often as a side effect of civil war. Countries where major human rights violations have been reported in recent times include the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Sierra Leone]], [[Liberia]], [[Sudan]], [[Zimbabwe]], and [[CÃ´te d'Ivoire]].

Although it has abundant [[natural resource]]s, Africa remains the world's poorest and most [[Human Development Index|underdeveloped]] continent, the result of a variety of causes that may include [[Corruption Perceptions Index|corrupt governments]] that have often committed serious [[human rights violations]], failed [[central planning]], high levels of [[illiteracy]], lack of access to foreign capital, and frequent tribal and military conflict (ranging from [[guerrilla warfare]] to [[genocide]]).&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sandbrook, ''The Politics of Africa's Economic Stagnation'', Cambridge University Press, 1985 passim&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Nations]]' Human Development Report in 2003, the bottom 24 ranked nations (151st to 175th) were all African.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdr.undp.org/], United Nations&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Poverty in Africa|Poverty]], illiteracy, [[malnutrition]] and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the African continent.

From 1995 to 2005, Africa's rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. Some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably [[Angola]], [[Sudan]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]], all of which had recently begun extracting their [[petroleum]] reserves or had expanded their [[oil extraction]] capacity.

In recent years, the [[People's Republic of China]] has built increasingly stronger ties with African nations and is Africa's largest trading partner. In 2007, Chinese companies invested a total of US$1 billion in Africa.&lt;ref name=Africa&gt;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=690 Malia Politzer, &quot;China and Africa: Stronger Economic Ties Mean More Migration&quot;], ''Migration Information Source''.

A Harvard University study led by professor [[Calestous Juma]] showed that Africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. &quot;African agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favored Africa's export of raw materials and importation of food. Africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/12/101202124337.htm &quot;Africa Can Feed Itself in a Generation, Experts Say&quot;], ''[[Science Daily]]'', 3 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During US President Barack Obama's visit to Africa in July 2013, he announced a [[United States dollar|US$]]7 billion plan to further develop infrastructure and work more intensively with African heads of state. He also announced a new program named Trade Africa, designed to boost trade within the continent as well as between Africa and the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The three reasons why the US is so interested in Africa right now|url=http://qz.com/100315/the-three-reasons-why-the-us-is-so-interested-in-africa-right-now/|work=Quartz|publisher=Quartz|accessdate=4 July 2013|author=Olga Khazan|date=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speakers of [[Bantu languages]] (part of the [[Nigerâ€“Congo languages|Nigerâ€“Congo]] family) are the majority in southern, central and southeast Africa. The Bantu-speaking peoples from [[The Sahel]] progressively expanded over most of Sub-Saharan Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Luc-Normand Tellier (2009).

ISBN 2-7605-1588-5&lt;/ref&gt; But there are also several [[Nilotic]] groups in [[South Sudan]] and East Africa, the mixed [[Swahili people]] on the [[Swahili Coast]], and a few remaining [[Indigenous peoples of Africa|indigenous]] Khoisan (&quot;[[Bushmen|San&quot;]] or &quot;Bushmen&quot;) and [[Pygmy peoples]] in southern and central Africa, respectively. Bantu-speaking Africans also predominate in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea, and are found in parts of southern Cameroon. In the [[Kalahari Desert]] of Southern Africa, the distinct people known as the Bushmen (also &quot;San&quot;, closely related to, but distinct from &quot;[[Khoikhoi|Hottentots]]&quot;) have long been present. The San are physically distinct from other Africans and are the indigenous people of southern Africa. Pygmies are the pre-Bantu indigenous peoples of central Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article402970.ece Pygmies struggle to survive in war zone where abuse is routine]. ''Times'' Online. 16 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The peoples of West Africa primarily speak [[Nigerâ€“Congo languages]], belonging mostly to its non-Bantu branches, though some [[Nilo-Saharan]] and Afro-Asiatic speaking groups are also found. The Nigerâ€“Congo-speaking [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Fulani]], [[Akan language|Akan]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] ethnic groups are the largest and most influential. In the central Sahara, [[Mandinka people|Mandinka]] or [[Mande languages|Mande]] groups are most significant. Chadic-speaking groups, including the [[Hausa language|Hausa]], are found in more northerly parts of the region nearest to the Sahara, and Nilo-Saharan communities, such as the [[Songhai people|Songhai]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and [[Zarma people|Zarma]], are found in the eastern parts of West Africa bordering [[Central Africa]].

The peoples of North Africa consist of three main indigenous groups: Berbers in the northwest, Egyptians in the northeast, and Nilo-Saharan-speaking peoples in the east. The [[Arab]]s who arrived in the 7th century AD introduced the [[Arabic language]] and Islam to North Africa. The Semitic [[Phoenicia]]ns (who founded [[Carthage]]) and [[Hyksos]], the Indo-Iranian [[Alans]], the Indo- European [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], and [[Vandals]] settled in North Africa as well. Significant Berber communities remain within [[Morocco]] and [[Algeria]] in the 21st century, while, to a lesser extent, Berber speakers are also present in some regions of Tunisia and Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q&amp;A: The Berbers|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3509799.stm|accessdate=30 December 2013|newspaper=BBC News|date=12 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berber-speaking [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and other often-[[nomad]]ic peoples are the principal inhabitants of the Saharan interior of North Africa. In Mauritania, there is a small but near-extinct Berber community in the north and Nigerâ€“Congo-speaking peoples in the south, though in both regions Arabic and Arab culture predominates. In Sudan, although Arabic and Arab culture predominate, it is mostly inhabited by groups that originally spoke Nilo-Saharan, such as the Nubians, Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa, who, over the centuries, have variously intermixed with migrants from the Arabian peninsula. Small communities of Afro-Asiatic-speaking Beja nomads can also be found in Egypt and Sudan.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[File:Bedscha.jpg|thumb|left|[[Beja people|Beja]] [[bedouin]]s from Northeast Africa]]
In the [[Horn of Africa]], some Ethiopian and [[Eritrea]]n groups (like the [[Amhara people|Amhara]] and [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigrayans]], collectively known as [[Habesha people|Habesha]]) speak languages from the [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language family, while the [[Oromo people|Oromo]] and [[Somali people|Somali]] speak languages from the [[Cushitic]] branch of Afro-Asiatic.

Prior to the [[decolonization]] movements of the post-[[World War II]] era, [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] were represented in every part of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,901759-3,00.html &quot;We Want Our Country&quot; (3 of 10)].

European colonization also brought sizable groups of [[Asian people|Asians]], particularly from the [[Indian subcontinent]], to British colonies. Large [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian communities]] are found in South Africa, and smaller ones are present in Kenya, Tanzania, and some other southern and southeast African countries. The large [[Indians in Uganda|Indian community in Uganda]] was [[expulsion of Asians from Uganda|expelled]] by the dictator [[Idi Amin]] in 1972, though many have since returned. The islands in the Indian Ocean are also populated primarily by people of Asian origin, often mixed with Africans and Europeans. The [[Malagasy people]] of [[Madagascar]] are an [[Austronesian people]], but those along the coast are generally mixed with Bantu, Arab, Indian and European origins. Malay and Indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in South Africa as [[Cape Coloureds]] (people with origins in two or more races and continents). During the 20th century, small but economically important communities of [[Demographics of Lebanon#The Lebanese Diaspora|Lebanese]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Africa&quot;/&gt; have also developed in the larger coastal cities of [[West Africa|West]] and [[East Africa]], respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.voanews.com/english/news/a-13-2007-07-10-voa46.html Naomi Schwarz, &quot;Lebanese Immigrants Boost West African Commerce&quot;], VOANews.com, 10 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

By most estimates, well over a thousand [[language]]s ([[UNESCO]] has estimated around two thousand) are spoken in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=8048&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Africa|date=2005|publisher=UNESCO|accessdate=1 March 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602050234/http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=8048&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html|archivedate=2 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most are of African origin, though some are of European or Asian origin. Africa is the most [[Multilingualism|multilingual]] continent in the world, and it is not rare for individuals to fluently speak not only multiple African languages, but one or more European ones as well. There are four major [[language family|language families]] indigenous to Africa:
* The [[Afroasiatic languages|''Afroasiatic'']] languages are a language family of about 240 languages and 285 million people widespread throughout the [[Horn of Africa]], [[North Africa]], the [[Sahel]], and [[Southwest Asia]].
* The [[Nilo-Saharan languages|''Nilo-Saharan'']] language family consists of more than a hundred languages spoken by 30 million people. Nilo-Saharan languages are spoken by ethnic groups in [[Chad]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Kenya]], [[Nigeria]], [[Sudan]], [[South Sudan]], [[Uganda]], and northern [[Tanzania]].
* The [[Nigerâ€“Congo languages|''Nigerâ€“Congo'']] language family covers much of Sub-Saharan Africa and is probably the largest language family in the world in terms of different languages.
* The [[Khoisan languages|''Khoisan'']] languages number about fifty and are spoken in [[Southern Africa]] by approximately 120,000 people. Many of the Khoisan languages are [[endangered language|endangered]]. The [[Khoikhoi|Khoi]] and [[Bushmen|San]] peoples are considered the original inhabitants of this part of Africa.

Following the end of [[colonialism]], nearly all African countries adopted [[official language]]s that originated outside the continent, although several countries also granted legal recognition to indigenous languages (such as [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]] and [[Hausa language|Hausa]]). In numerous countries, [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] (''see [[African French]]'') are used for communication in the public sphere such as government, commerce, education and the media. [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Afrikaans]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are examples of languages that trace their origin to outside of Africa, and that are used by millions of Africans today, both in the public and private spheres. [[Italian language|Italian]] is spoken by some in former [[Italian Colonial Empire|Italian colonies]] in Africa. [[German language|German]] is spoken in [[Namibia]], as it was a former [[Germany|German]] protectorate.

{{Main article|Culture of Africa}}
Some aspects of traditional African cultures have become less practiced in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. For example, African customs were discouraged, and African languages were prohibited in mission schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;pearsonhighered.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0205208606.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Leopold II of Belgium attempted to &quot;civilize&quot; Africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;pearsonhighered.com&quot;/&gt;

Abiola Irele and Simon Gikandi comment that the current identity of African literature had its genesis in the &quot;traumatic encounter between Africa and Europe.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://universitypublishingonline.org/cambridge/histories/chapter.jsf?bid=CBO9781139054638&amp;cid=CBO9781139054638A024]&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Mhoze Chikowero believes that Africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to (re)asset themselves as active agents and indigenous intellectuals, to unmake their colonial marginalization and reshape their own destinies.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=o3y9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=colonialism+suppressed+african+music&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ss4uuLEtML&amp;sig=ADS7RWH5sWhGf18gbxY1lUcRdnI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi46YfryObJAhUM5GMKHQgzAusQ6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=colonialism%20suppressed%20african%20music&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue African traditional cultures, under such movements as the [[African Renaissance]], led by [[Thabo Mbeki]], [[Afrocentrism]], led by a group of scholars, including [[Molefi Asante]], as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of [[West African Vodun|Vodou]] and other forms of spirituality.

===Visual art and architecture===
[[African art]] and [[architecture of Africa|architecture]] reflect the diversity of African cultures. The region's oldest known [[bead]]s were made from ''[[Nassarius]]'' shells and worn as personal ornaments 72,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Handbook of African Archaeology'' (2013, ISBN 0191626147), page 375&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Pyramid of Giza]] in [[Egypt]] was the [[world's tallest structure]] for 4,000 years, until the completion of [[Lincoln Cathedral]] around the year 1300. The stone ruins of [[Great Zimbabwe]] are also noteworthy for their architecture, as are the [[monolithic church]]es at [[Lalibela]], Ethiopia, such as the [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela|Church of Saint George]].

===Music and dance===
{{Main article|Music of Africa}}
[[File:Namibia Rugby Team.jpg|right|thumb|upright|The [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia rugby team]]]]
Egypt has long been a cultural focus of [[Arab world|the Arab world]], while remembrance of the rhythms of sub-Saharan Africa, in particular West Africa, was transmitted through the [[Atlantic slave trade]] to modern [[samba]], [[blues]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], [[hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[rock music|rock]]. The 1950s through the 1970s saw a conglomeration of these various styles with the popularization of [[Afrobeat]] and [[Highlife]] music. Modern music of the continent includes the highly complex choral singing of southern Africa and the dance rhythms of the musical genre of [[soukous]], dominated by the [[music of the Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Indigenous musical and dance traditions of Africa are maintained by oral traditions, and they are distinct from the music and dance styles of [[North Africa]] and [[Southern Africa]]. [[Arab]] influences are visible in North African music and dance and, in Southern Africa, [[Western culture#Widespread influence|Western influences]] are apparent due to [[colonization]].

===Sports===
Fifty-three African countries have [[Association football|football (soccer)]] teams in the [[Confederation of African Football]]. Egypt has won the African Cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. Cameroon, Nigeria, Senegal, Ghana, and Algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent [[FIFA World Cup]]s. [[South Africa]] hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup tournament]], becoming the first African country to do so.

[[Cricket]] is popular in some African nations. [[South Africa national cricket team|South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] have [[Test cricket|Test]] status, while [[Kenya national cricket team|Kenya]] is the leading non-test team and previously had [[One Day International|One-Day International cricket]] (ODI) status (from [[President's Cup 1997-98|10 October 1997]], until [[2014 Cricket World Cup Qualifier#Super Six|30 January 2014]]). The three countries jointly hosted the [[2003 Cricket World Cup]]. [[Namibia national cricket team|Namibia]] is the other African country to have played in a World Cup. [[Morocco]] in northern Africa has also hosted the [[2002 Morocco Cup]], but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. [[Rugby union|Rugby]] is a popular sport in South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe.

==Religion==
{{Main article|Religion in Africa}}
Africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive a topic for governments with mixed religious populations.&lt;ref name=stanford&gt;[http://library.stanford.edu/africa/religion.html &quot;African Religion on the Internet&quot;], [[Stanford University]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C00EEDC1030F932A35752C1A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|date=1 November 2001|title=Rising Muslim Power in Africa Causing Unrest in Nigeria and Elsewhere|first=Normitsu|last=Onishi|work=The New York Times|accessdate=1 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Book Encyclopedia]], [[Islam in Africa|Islam]] is the largest religion in Africa, followed by [[Christianity in Africa|Christianity]]. According to [[Encyclopedia Britannica]], 45% of the population are [[Christian]]s, 40% are [[Muslim]]s, and 10% follow [[African Traditional Religion|traditional religions]]. A small number of Africans are [[Hindu]], [[Buddhist]], [[Confucianist]], [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith|Baha'i]], or have beliefs from the [[Judaism in Africa|Judaic tradition]]. There is also a minority of Africans who are [[Irreligion in Africa|irreligious]].
