The name ''[[:wikt:Pakistan|Pakistan]]'' literally means &quot;[[-stan|Land of]] the Pure&quot; in [[Urdu]] and [[Persian language|Persian]]. It comes from the word ''[[:wikt:Ù¾Ø§Ú©|pÄ?k]]'' meaning ''pure'' in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Dictionary of Pashto|last=Raverty|first=Henry George|url=http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.0:1:1478.raverty}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the word [[-stan|''istÄ?n'']] is a Persian word meaning ''place of''; it is a cognate of the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[:wikt:à¤¸à¥?à¤¥à¤¾à¤¨|sthÄ?na]]'' ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|à¤¸à¥?à¤¥à¤¾à¤¨}} {{IPA-sa|stÌªÊ°aË?nÉ™|}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanskritdictionary.com/sth%C4%81na/274192/1l|title=Monier-Williams Sanskrit Dictionary|date=1872|accessdate=28 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Creation of Pakistan|independence]] and the [[Partition of India|partition]] of [[Presidencies and provinces of British India|India]] in 1947, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the [[Party chair|President]] of [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]], became nation's first [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Governor-General]] as well as first [[Speaker of the National Assembly of Pakistan|President-Speaker]] of the [[Parliament of Pakistan|Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;king-queen&quot; /&gt; Meanwhile, Pakistan's [[Founding Fathers of Pakistan|founding fathers]] agreed upon appointing [[Liaquat Ali Khan]], the [[Secretary General|secretary-general]] of the [[All-India Muslim League|party]], the nation's [[List of Prime Ministers of Pakistan|first]] [[Prime Ministers of Pakistan|Prime Minister]].

[[Shabbir Ahmad Usmani|ShabbÄ«r Ahmad UsmÄ?n]]Ä«, a respected DeobandÄ« Ê¿''Ä?lim'' (scholar) who occupied the position of Shaykh al-IslÄ?m in Pakistan in 1949, and [[Abul A'la Maududi|Maulana Mawdud]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;i of [[Jamaat-e-Islami|JamÄ?Ê¿at-i IslÄ?mÄ«]] played a pivotal role in the demand for an Islamic constitution. [[Abul A'la Maududi|MawdÅ«dÄ«]] demanded that the Constituent Assembly make an explicit declaration affirming the &quot;supreme sovereignty of God&quot; and the supremacy of the ''sharÄ«Ê¿ah'' in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot;&gt;Hussain, Rizwan . &quot;Pakistan.&quot; In ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World''.

A significant result of the efforts of the JamÄ?Ê¿at-i IslÄ?mÄ« and the Ê¿''ulamÄ?Ê¿'' was the passage of the [[Objectives Resolution]] in March 1949. The Objectives Resolution, which [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] called the second most important step in Pakistan's history, declared that &quot;sovereignty over the entire universe belongs to God Almighty alone and the authority which He has delegated to the State of Pakistan through its people for being exercised within the limits prescribed by Him is a sacred trust&quot;. The Objectives Resolution has been incorporated as a preamble to the constitutions of 1956, 1962, and 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;:0&quot; /&gt;

The climate varies from tropical to temperate, with arid conditions in the coastal south. There is a [[monsoon]] season with frequent flooding due to heavy rainfall, and a dry season with significantly less rainfall or none at all. There are four distinct seasons: a cool, dry winter from December through February; a hot, dry spring from March through May; the summer rainy season, or southwest monsoon period, from June through September; and the retreating monsoon period of October and November.&lt;ref name=&quot;congress&quot; /&gt; Rainfall varies greatly from year to year, and patterns of alternate flooding and drought are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Asia-and-Oceania/Pakistan-CLIMATE.html|title=Pakistan Climate|publisher=Encyclopedia of the Nations|date=28 March 2008|accessdate=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The diversity of landscapes and climates in Pakistan allows a wide variety of trees and plants to flourish. The forests range from coniferous [[alpine plant|alpine]] and [[subalpine]] trees such as [[spruce]], [[pine]] and [[deodar cedar]] in the extreme northern mountains, through [[deciduous]] trees in most of the country (for example the mulberry-like [[Dalbergia sissoo|shisham]] found in the [[Sulaiman Mountains]]), to palms such as [[coconut]] and [[Phoenix dactylifera|date]] in southern Punjab, southern Balochistan and all of Sindh. The western hills are home to [[juniper]], [[tamarisk]], coarse grasses and scrub plants. [[Mangrove]] forests form much of the coastal wetlands along the coast in the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwfpak.org/forest_mangrove.php|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041225000128/http://wwfpak.org/forest_mangrove.php|archivedate=25 December 2004|title=Conservation of Mangrove Forests in the Coastal Areas of Sindh and Balochistan|work=WWF Pakistan|accessdate=17 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coniferous forests are found at altitudes ranging from 1,000 to 4,000 metres in most of the northern and northwestern highlands. In the [[xeric]] regions of Balochistan, date palm and ''[[Ephedra (genus)|Ephedra]]'' are common. In most of Punjab and Sindh, the Indus plains support tropical and subtropical dry and moist broadleaf forestry as well as tropical and xeric shrublands. These forests are mostly of [[mulberry]], [[acacia]], and [[eucalyptus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introduction|url=http://www.rrcap.unep.org/lc/cd/html/countryrep/pakistan/introduction.html|work=AIT-UNEP RRC.AP|accessdate=27 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 2.2% or {{convert|1687000|ha|km2}} of Pakistan was forested in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Rhett Butler|url=http://rainforests.mongabay.com/deforestation/2000/Pakistan.htm|title=Pakistan Deforestation Rates and Related Forestry Figures|work=Mongabay.com|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fauna of Pakistan reflects its varied climates too. Around 668 bird species are found there:&lt;ref name=&quot;wwf11&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt; [[crow]]s, [[sparrow]]s, [[Acridotheres|mynas]], [[hawk]]s, [[falcon]]s and [[eagle]]s commonly occur.

==== Agriculture and Primary Sector ====
The structure of the Pakistani economy has changed from [[Agriculture in Pakistan|a mainly agricultural]] to a strong service base. Agriculture {{As of|2010|lc=y}} accounts for only 21.2% of the GDP. Even so, according to the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], Pakistan produced 21,591,400 metric tons of wheat in 2005, more than all of Africa (20,304,585 metric tons) and nearly as much as all of South America (24,557,784 metric tons).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbp.org.pk/departments/stats/PakEconomy_HandBook/Chap-1.2.pdf|title=Sectoral Share in Gross Domestic Product|year=2010|format=PDF|publisher=Federal Bureau of Statistics|page=10|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Majority of the population, directly or indirectly, is dependent on this sector. It accounts for half of employed labour force and is the largest source of foreign exchange earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.gov.pk/content/agriculture-statistics|title=Agriculture Statistics {{!}} Pakistan Bureau of Statistics|website=www.pbs.gov.pk|access-date=2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large portion of the country's manufactured exports are dependent on raw materials such as cotton and hides that are part of the agriculture sector, while supply shortages and market disruptions in farm products do push up inflationary pressures. The country is also the fifth largest producer of cotton, with cotton production of 14 million bales from a modest beginning of 1.7 million bales in the early 1950s; is self sufficient in sugarcane; and is the fourth largest producer in the world of milk.  Land and water resources have not risen proportionately, but the increases have taken place mainly due to gains in labor and agriculture productivity. The major breakthrough in crop production took place in the late 1960s and 1970s due to the [[Green Revolution]] that made a significant contribution to land and yield increases of wheat and rice. Private tube wells led to a 50 percent increase in the cropping intensity which was augmented by tractor cultivation.  While the tube wells raised crop yields by 50 percent, the High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) of wheat and rice led to a 50â€“60 percent higher yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=iba.edu.pk/News/...drishrat/AgricultureSector_Issues_n_Prospects.docx|title=AGRICULTURE SECTOR: ISSUES AND PROSPECTS.|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meat industry accounts for 1.4 percent of overall GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapter_10/03_Manufacturing.pdf|title=Manufacturing in Pakistan|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Government of Pakistan|access-date=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Manufacturing ====

[[Manufacturing]] is the third largest sector of the economy, accounting for 18.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and 13 percent of total employment. Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM), at 12.2 percent of GDP, dominates the overall sector, accounting for 66% of the sectoral share, followed by Small Scale Manufacturing, which accounts for 4.9 percent of total GDP. Pakistan's [[cement]] industry is also fast growing mainly because of demand from [[Afghanistan]] and from the domestic real estate sector. In 2013 Pakistan exported 7,708,557 [[metric tons]] of cement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apcma.com/data_export.html|title=All Pakistan Cement Manufacturers Association Export Data|publisher=Apcma.com|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan has an installed capacity of 44,768,250 metric tons of cement and 42,636,428 metric tons of clinker. In 2012 and 2013, the cement industry in Pakistan became the most profitable sector of the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bhutta|first=Zafar|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/552042/cant-get-enough-soaring-profits-not-enough-for-cement-industry/|title=Canâ€™t get enough: Soaring profits not enough for cement industry|publisher=Tribune.com.pk|date=21 May 2013|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Textile industry in Pakistan|textile industry]] enjoys a pivotal position in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan. Pakistan is the 8th largest exporter of textile products in Asia. This sector contributes 9.5% to the [[GDP]] and provides employment to about 15 million people or roughly 30% of the 49 million workforce of the country. Pakistan is the 4th largest producer of [[cotton]] with the third largest spinning capacity in Asia after China and India, and contributes 5% to the global spinning capacity. China is the second largest buyer of Pakistani textiles, importing US$1.527 billion of textiles last fiscal. Unlike U.S. where mostly value added textiles are imported, China buys only cotton yarn and cotton fabric from Pakistan. In 2012, Pakistani textile products accounted for 3.3% or US$1.07[[1,000,000,000|bn]] of total United Kingdom's textile imports, 12.4% or US$4.61[[1,000,000,000|bn]] of total Chinese textile imports, 2.98% or $2.98b of total United States' textile imports, 1.6% or US$0.88[[1,000,000,000|bn]] of total German textile imports and 0.7% or US$0.888[[1,000,000,000|bn]] of total Indian textile imports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baig|first=Khurram|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/522293/anatomy-of-an-indispensable-sector-why-the-pakistan-textile-industry-cannot-die/|title=Why the Pakistan textile industry cannot die|publisher=Tribune.com.pk|date=18 March 2013|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth rate of services sector is higher than the growth rate of agriculture and industrial sector.

For the commercial usage of the [[Nuclear power plant|nuclear power]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] has provided an avid support for commercializing the nuclear power sources in Pakistan from early on, first providing the [[CHASNUPP-1|Chashma-I]] reactor. The [[Karachi Nuclear Power Plant|Karachi-I]], a [[CANDU reactor|Candu-type]], was provided by [[Canada]] in 1971â€“ the country's first commercial [[nuclear power plant]]. In subsequent years, [[People's Republic of China]] sold the [[nuclear power plant]] for energy and industrial growth of the country. In 2005, [[China and Pakistan|both countries]] reached out towards working on joint energy security plan, calling for a huge increase in generating capacity to more than 160,000&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MWe]] by 2030. Original admissions by Pakistan, the [[Pakistan Government|government]] plans for lifting nuclear capacity to 8800&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MWe]], 900&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MWe]] of it by 2015 and a further 1500&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MWe]] by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ijaz|first=Muhammad, Director of Scientific Information and Public Relation (SIPR)|title=PAEC assigned 8,800 MWe nuclear power target by 2030:PAEC contributing to socio-economic uplift of the country|journal=PakAtom Newsletter|volume=49|issue=1â€“2|pages=1â€“8|publisher=Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|location=Islamabad, Islamabad Capital Territory|date=December 2010|url=http://www.paec.gov.pk/newsletters/pkatm-n/p-nd10.pdf}}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, the nuclear [[Chashma Nuclear Power Complex|commercial complex]] was expanded with the ground work of installing and operationalizing the [[Chashma Nuclear Power Complex|Chashma-III]] and [[Chashma Nuclear Power Complex|Chashmaâ€“IV]] nuclear power plants at [[Chashma, Pakistan|Chashma]], [[Punjab (Pakistani province)|Punjab Province]], each with 320â€“340&amp;nbsp;MWe and costing [[Pakistan Rupee|â‚¨.]]&amp;nbsp;129&amp;nbsp;billion,; from which the [[Pakistan Rupee|â‚¨.]] 80&amp;nbsp;billion of this from international sources, principally China.

A further agreement for China's help with the project was signed in October 2008, and given prominence as a counter to the [[Indiaâ€“United States Civil Nuclear Agreement|U.S.â€“India agreement]] shortly preceding it. Cost quoted then was US$1.7&amp;nbsp;billion, with a foreign loan component of $1.07&amp;nbsp;billion. In 2013, the second nuclear [[Karachi Nuclear Power Complex|commercial complex]] in [[Karachi]] was marginalized and expanded to additional reactors, based on the [[Chashma Nuclear Power Complex|Chashma complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bhutta|first1=Zafar|title=Govt to kick off work on 1,100MW nuclear power plant|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/559885/govt-to-kick-off-work-on-1100mw-nuclear-power-plant/|accessdate=19 January 2015|agency=Express Tribune|date=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[National Highways of Pakistan|Highways]] form the backbone of Pakistan's transport system; a total road length of 259,618&amp;nbsp;km accounts for 91% of passenger and 96% of freight traffic. Road transport services are largely in the hands of the [[Privatization in Pakistan|private sector]], which handles around 95% of freight traffic. The [[National Highway Authority (Pakistan)|National Highway Authority]] is responsible for the maintenance of national highways and motorways. The highway and motorway system depends mainly on northâ€“south links, connecting the southern ports to the populous provinces of [[Punjab]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]].

The [[Pakistan Railways]], under the [[Ministry of Railways (Pakistan)|Ministry of Railways]] (MoR), operates the railroad system. From 1947 until the 1970s, the [[Pakistan Railways|train system]] was the primary means of transport until the nationwide constructions of the [[National Highways of Pakistan|national highways]] and the [[economic boom]] of the [[Cars in Pakistan|automotive industry]]. Since the 1990s, there was a marked shift in traffic from rail to highways; dependence grew on roads after the introduction of [[Automotive industry in Pakistan|vehicles]] in the country. Now the railway's share of inland traffic is only 10% for passengers and 4% for freight traffic. Personal transportation dominated by the automobiles, the total rail track decreased from 8,775&amp;nbsp;km in 1990â€“91 to 7,791&amp;nbsp;km in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;pc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=PAKISTAN|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/economies/Asia-and-the-Pacific/Pakistan.html|work=Encyclopedia Nation|accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan expects to use the rail service to boost [[Foreign trade of Pakistan|foreign trade]] with China, Iran and Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Syed Fazl-e-Haider|title=China-Pakistan rail link on horizon|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/IB24Df02.html|accessdate=31 December 2011|newspaper=Asia Times Online|date=24 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan-Turkey rail trial starts|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8201934.stm|accessdate=13 March 2012|publisher=BBC|date=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rough estimates accounts for 139 [[airfield|airports]] in Pakistanâ€“both [[Military of Pakistan|military]] and [[Civil Aviation Authority (Panama)|civilian]] airports which are [[List of airports in Pakistan|mostly publicly owned]]. Though the [[Jinnah International Airport]] is the principal international gateway to Pakistan, the international airports in [[Allama Iqbal International Airport|Lahore]], [[Benazir Bhutto International Airport|Islamabad]], [[Peshawar International Airport|Peshawar]], [[Quetta International Airport|Quetta]], [[Faisalabad International Airport|Faisalabad]], [[Sialkot International Airport|Sialkot]] and [[Multan International Airport|Multan]] also handle significant amounts of traffic. The [[List of airlines of Pakistan|civil aviation industry]] is mixed with [[Nationalization in Pakistan|public]] and [[Privatization in Pakistan|private]] sectors, which has been [[Privatization in Pakistan|deregulated]] in 1993. While the [[State owned enterprises|state-owned]] [[Pakistan International Airlines]] (PIA) is the major and dominated air carrier that carries about 73% of domestic passengers and all domestic freight, the private airlines such as [[Airblue|airBlue]], [[Shaheen Air|Shaheen Air International]], and [[Air Indus]], also provide the similar services with [[Low cost carrier|low cost]] expenses.  Major seaports are in [[Karachi]], [[Sindh]] (the [[Port of Karachi|Karachi port]] and [[Port Qasim]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;pc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nation&quot; /&gt; Since the 1990s, some seaport operations have been moved to [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] with the construction of [[Gwadar port|Gwadar Port]] and [[Gadani ship-breaking yard|Gadani Port]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nation&quot; /&gt; According to Mundi Index, quality ratings of Pakistan's seaports increased from 3.6 to 4 between 2006 and 2009.{{sfn|Robert Stimson|Kingsley E.

=== Water supply and sanitation ===
{{Main article|Water supply and sanitation in Pakistan}}Despite high population growth the country has increased the share of the population with access to an [[improved water source]] from 85% in 1990 to 92% in 2010, although this does not necessarily mean that the water from these sources is safe to drink. The share with access to [[improved sanitation]] increased from 27% to 48% during the same period, according to the [[Joint Monitoring Program for Water Supply and Sanitation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADB 11&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bridges|first=Geoff|author2=Asian Development Bank (ADB)|authorlink2=Asian Development Bank|title=Asian Water Development Outlook 2007.

However, the sector still faces major challenges. The quality of the services is poor, as evidenced by intermittent water 
supply in urban areas and limited [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment]].

===Clothing, arts, and fashion===

Each province has its own style of wearing the ''Shalwar Kameez''.

The [[Pakistani fashion|fashion industry]] has flourished well in the changing environment of the fashion world. Since Pakistan came into being, its fashion has historically evolved from different phases and made its unique identity apart from Indian fashion and culture. At this time, Pakistani fashion is a combination of traditional and modern dresses and it has become the cultural identification of Pakistan. Despite all modern trends, the regional and traditional dresses have developed their own significance as a symbol of native tradition. This regional fashion is not static but evolving into more modern and pure forms. The Pakistan Fashion Design Council based in [[Lahore]] organizes ''Fashion Week'' and Fashion Pakistan based in [[Karachi]] organizes fashion shows in that city. Pakistan's first fashion week was held in November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michele Langevine Leiby|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/in-pakistan-fashion-weeks-thrive-beyond-the-style-capitals-of-the-world/2012/04/24/gIQAt3qcgT_story.html|title=In Pakistan, fashion weeks thrive beyond the style capitals of the world|publisher=Washingtonpost.com|date=25 April 2012|accessdate=20 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pakistani cultural influence|social status]] of [[women in Pakistan]] varies and considerably depends on the [[social class]], [[Nature versus nurture|upbringings, and regional divide]] due to uneven [[socioeconomic development]] and the [[Socioeconomic impact of female education|impact]] of social formations on women's lives in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb_wom_pak&quot; /&gt; Pakistan has had a long history of feminist activism since its birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb_wom_pak&quot; /&gt; Since 1947, the [[All Pakistan Women's Association|APWA]] and [[Aurat Foundation]]â€“ the influential feminist organizationsâ€” have played strong roles in inculcating awareness about women's rights in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb_wom_pak&quot; /&gt; Personalities such as [[Sheila Irene Pant|Begum Rana'a]], [[Benazir Bhutto]], [[Malala Yousafzai]] and [[Kalsoom Nawaz Sharif|Kalsoom Nawaz]] have been influential in Pakistan's feminist culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;adb_wom_pak&quot; /&gt; The status of women, overall, has improved due to enhanced religious and educational knowledge. However, with regard to the global average, the situation is quite alarming. In 2014, the [[World Economic Forum]] ranked Pakistan as the second worst country in the world in [[gender equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/pakistan/Pakistan-second-worst-country-in-gender-equality/articleshow/44961322.cms|title=Pakistan second-worst country in gender equality|work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship of women with the opposite gender is culturally that of [[gender subordination]]. There are certain assumed and assigned roles of women that are related to domestic chores compared with men who are the breadwinners and professionals of the family. Contrastingly, in urban areas of the country, more and more women are assuming professional roles and are contributing to family economics but the ratio of these women compared with those in traditional roles is way less. Most favoured occupations for females accepted by society are that of [[Teaching]] and [[Tutoring]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adb_wom_pak&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/institutional-document/32562/files/women-pakistan.pdf|title=Women in Pakistan: Country Briefing Paper|author=Mariam S.

===Urbanisation===
{{main article|Urbanisation in Pakistan}}
[[File:Empress Market at Sunset.jpg|thumb|left|Long exposure of [[Empress Market]] in [[Karachi]].]]
Since [[Independence of Pakistan|achieving independence]] as a result of the [[Partition of India|partition]] of [[India]], the [[Urbanisation in Pakistan|urbanization]] has exponentially increased and has several different causes for it.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Urban Frontierâ€”Karachi&quot; /&gt; Majority of [[Southern Pakistan|southern side population]] resides along the [[Indus River]], with [[Karachi]] being its most populous commercial city.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Urban Frontierâ€”Karachi&quot; /&gt; On the [[Eastern Pakistan|east]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|west]], and [[Northern Pakistan|northern skirts]], the most of the population lives in an arc formed by the cities of [[Lahore]], [[Faisalabad]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Islamabad]], [[Sargodha]], [[Gujranwala]], [[Sialkot]], [[Gujrat city|Gujrat]], [[Jhelum]], [[Sheikhupura]], [[Nowshera, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa|Nowshera]], [[Mardan]] and [[Peshawar]]. During [[Fiscal year|1990â€“2008]], the city dwellers made up 36.0% of Pakistan's population, making it the most urbanised nation in [[South Asia]]. Furthermore, more than 50% of Pakistanis live in towns of 5,000 people or more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jason Burke&quot; /&gt; [[Immigration to Pakistan|Immigration]], both from within and outside the country, is regarded as one of the main factors that has contributed to urbanisation in Pakistan. One analysis of the [[1998 Pakistan Census|national census]] held in 1998 highlighted the significance of the [[Partition of India]] in the 1940s in the context of understanding urban change in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Clark|first=David|title=The Elgar Companion to Development Studies|year=2006|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|isbn=978-1843764755|page=668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the independence period, Muslim [[Muhajir people|Muhajirs]] from [[India]] migrated in large numbers and shifted their domicile to Pakistan, especially to the port city of [[Karachi]], which is today the largest metropolis in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot; /&gt;
[[Immigration to Pakistan|Migration from other countries]], mainly those in the neighbourhood, has further catalysed the process of urbanisation in Pakistani cities. Of particular interest is migration that occurred in the aftermath of the independence of [[Bangladesh]] in 1971,&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot; /&gt; in the form of stranded [[Stranded Pakistanis|Biharis]] who were relocated to Pakistan. Smaller numbers of [[Bengalis in Pakistan|Bengalis]] and [[Burmese people in Pakistan|Burmese]] immigrants followed suit much later. The [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|conflict]] in [[Afghanistan]] also forced millions of [[Afghans in Pakistan|Afghan refugees]] into Pakistan, particularly in the northwestern regions. Inevitably, the rapid urbanisation caused by these large population movements has also brought new political and socio-economic complexities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot; /&gt; In addition to immigration, economic events such as the green revolution and political developments, among a host of other factors, are also important causes of urbanisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark&quot; /&gt;

The term ''[[Overseas Pakistani]]'' is officially recognized by the [[Government of Pakistan]]; the [[Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis]] was established in 2008 to exclusively deal with all the matters and affairs of the overseas Pakistanis such as attending to their needs and problems, intending schemes and projects for their welfare and working for resolution of their problems and issues. [[Overseas Pakistani]] workers are the second largest source of Foreign Exchange Remittances to Pakistan after exports and over the last several years, the foreign exchange remittances have maintained a steady rising trend, with a recorded increase of 150% from US$6 billion in 2009 to estimated US$15 billion during 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;remit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1176411|title=Pakistan's remittances|author=Sakib Sherani|work=dawn.com|accessdate=17 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009â€“10, Pakistanis sent home US$9.4 billion, the eleventh-largest total remittance in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank1&quot; /&gt; By 2012, Pakistan increased its ranking to tenth in the world for remittances with a total sum of US$13 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;overseaspakistanis1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank1&quot; /&gt; The Overseas Pakistani Division (OPD) was created in September 2004 within the [[Ministry of Labour (Pakistan)|Ministry of Labour]] (MoL), and has since recognized the importance of overseas Pakistanis and their contribution to the [[Economy of Pakistan|nation's economy]]. Together with Community Welfare Attaches (CWAs) and the Overseas Pakistanis Foundation (OPF), the OPD is improving the welfare of Pakistanis who reside abroad. The division aims to provide better services through improved facilities at [[airports]], and suitable schemes for housing, [[education]] and [[health care]]â€”its largest effort is the facilitation of the rehabilitation of returning overseas Pakistanis.

Pakistani cuisine is similar to cuisine from other regions of [[South Asia]], since much of it originated from the royal kitchens of sixteenth-century Mughal emperors. Pakistan has a greater variety of meat dishes compared to the rest of the sub-continent. Most of those dishes have their roots in [[British cuisine|British]], [[Central Asian cuisine|Central Asian]] and [[Middle Eastern cuisine]].  Pakistani cooking uses large quantities of spices, herbs and seasoning. [[Garlic]], [[ginger]], [[turmeric]], red [[chilli]] and [[garam masala]] are used in most dishes, and home cooking regularly includes curry. [[Chapati]], a thin flat bread made from wheat, is a staple food, served with curry, meat, vegetables and lentils.
